       "' \\n\\n \\n\\nit had been some time since akaashi set foot into that hospital\\n\\nit was a dreary place for him a place he was not fond of but a place he was obligated to visit akaashis parents were intent on having him intern in a hospital nearby so that he could stockpile more things that would look good on his resume for future purposes\\n\\noften times however akaashi would disagree with his parents unhappy with the suggestions theyd given him but ultimately they would urge him to carry out the task that had been pushed on him and one way or another hed do it\\n\\nasking around here and there the male put little to no effort in finding out where he could go to sign up for what he didnt care nor did he think he would care in the near future akaashi was unhappy with where he was unhappy with what it was that he was doing he was wasting time asking for something that he did not want in the least\\n\\npointing a finger down the hall a small assistant nurse directed akaashi to a different desk one where he would be able to find more information on the subject blatantly he thanked her and continued on his way passing by several rooms as he did so\\n\\nhis eyes where set forward he didnt look into any of the rooms he didnt want to it would hurt if he did\\n\\nakaashi closed his eyes and sighed swaying absentmindedly in his step opening his eyes just in time to swiftly avoid colliding with someone\\n\\n\\na doctor no just another person\\n\\n\\nhe circled around the male apologizing flatly before he continued on an its alright could be heard from behind him but it soon faded as akaashi continued forward\\n\\n\\ndo i really want to do this\\n\\n\\nhis eyes stared forward uninterested in the information desk several meters from him\\n\\n\\nno i really dont\\n\\n\\nstanding still akaashi remained in place for quite some time his legs refusing to carry him further people walked by him around him up and down the halls to and fro but no one seemed to notice him he stood there hesitant uninterested indifferent\\n\\nunfeeling\\n\\nhe remained in place silently no one was bothered by him so there he stood he brought a hand up to push through his black hair and slowly his head fell forward akaashi stared at his shoes\\n\\n\\nwhat am i doing\\n\\n\\nthe thought rattled his mind\\n\\n\\nwhy am i even here\\n\\n\\nanother person walked by at a gradual pace at first then slowed progressively as they drew near their walking then slowed to a halt and it was then that akaashi had become aware of the new individual whod invaded his personal space\\n\\nfrom his peripheral akaashi could see their hand reaching out to him\\n\\nhe withdrew and looked up\\n\\noh you can move he smiled in akaashis direction bright yellow eyes catching his own it had been the same guy hed almost bumped into perhaps hed remained in the hall and watched as akaashi had gone from a brisk walk to a sudden stop he understood how that would be alarming to some people\\n\\nis there something wrong with me standing here akaashi asked sincerely\\n\\nno i dont think so he brought his hand down to his side why did you stop so suddenly are you alright\\n\\nim fine i was just thinking akaashi blinked slowly\\n\\nof what\\n\\n\\na question asker how thrilling \\n\\n\\nof this hospital ive realized that i dont want to come here anymore\\n\\nthe male who stood across from akaashi shifted his weight to one leg were you sick are you checking out\\n\\nakaashi stared through the stranger no im not sick but this place makes me feel like i am his answer was cold but it did not seem to cut through the others pleasant mood\\n\\ni feel the same about this place honestly he paused so you must be leaving soon then\\n\\nyeah akaashi shifted leaning in the direction of where hed come from\\n\\nhe had no interest in staying where he was his only intention was leaving he figured he would tell his parents that the people in the hospital were too occupied with everything else to tend to him he started on his way without so much as a second glance in the others direction goodbye\\n\\nhey hey\\n\\nakaashi turned his head what\\n\\nwhats your name\\n\\nwhy did he want to know his name when would he ever use it again the stranger could have been a patient at the hospital for all akaashi knew and the last thing he needed was a sickly acquaintance to add to his already short list of friends\\n\\nyou dont need to know\\n\\nthe male across from him did well in hiding the look of offense that almost surfaced upon his face i understand but for what its worth my name is bokuto\\n\\nakaashi cast a weary look in bokutos direction gave a nod and continued on his way until he was out of the building\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\ntwo weeks had passed since akaashis last visit and to his dismay he found himself on the same aimless path back to the same dreaded hospital he couldnt stand his parents persistent natures but he was somewhat relieved to be out of the house to say the least\\n\\n\\nhere we go again\\n\\n\\nakaashi entered the building and greeted the woman at the front desk as always he wasted no time ascending the steps needed to get to the part of the hospital where hed almost reached all that time ago in minutes the information desk was in his sights and for the first time in forever hed actually gone to it\\n\\nhe spoke with a small woman there and after several minutes had passed akaashi backed away from the desk some sheets of paper in hand he started down the hall sighing heavily intent on rushing home\\n\\nhey hey its you\\n\\nthe familiar voice made akaashis throat tighten another sigh was forced out even heavier this time he turned around\\n\\nbokuto\\n\\napathykun he grinned from ear to ear\\n\\ndont call me that akaashi stuffed the sheets into his bag\\n\\ni thought you said you werent ever going to set foot in here again there was something strange about the excitement in his tone\\n\\ni didnt say exactly that\\n\\nbut it was implied\\n\\nakaashi squinted\\n\\nyes it was implied\\n\\nbokutos smile never left his face and his tired eyelids contradicted his facial expression\\n\\n\\nwhy must i always run into the strange ones \\n\\n\\nso what brings you here again\\n\\ni could ask you the same thing akaashis lips screwed to the side\\n\\nthick white eyebrows raised above yellow hues im supposed to be here actually\\n\\nakaashi yawned intern\\n\\nno patient his smile was unnerving\\n\\nsilently the dark haired male frowned ive been insensitive\\n\\na laugh bubbled out from bokuto no you havent dont worry about it\\n\\nthough hed been dressed in normal casual clothing upon further examination there was indeed something sickly about him he was paler than the others who walked along in the halls and soft dark circles sat under his eyes\\n\\nakaashi made sure not to stare\\n\\ni know you arent going to ask so ill just let you know from what ive heard the doctors say that whatever i have is called ffi bokuto folded his arms he held an air around him as if he were having a normal conversation about the weather fatal familial insomnia if i remember correctly\\n\\na cold shiver curled up akaashis spine hed never heard of that disease before it worried him enough to get some words out of him\\n\\ni dont think i want to ask about the symptoms of this illness\\n\\nwell even if you wanted to i wouldnt have an answer for you another laugh all i can say is that sleeping doesnt come as easily as it used to what normally would have pained someone to say he delivered with ease and with that same grin to boot\\n\\nakaashi couldnt help but almost smile back his lips barely twitching he stared in bokutos direction at him this time are you here every day\\n\\nof course been here for about four weeks now he blinked sluggishly\\n\\ni see akaashi nodded once no words were exchanged for a moment and soon the short amount of silence had become awkward well ill be going now\\n\\n\\nshut him out dont let him in hes sick \\n\\n\\nahuh one second\\n\\nakaashis jaw clenched i have to go bokuto he started on his way\\n\\n\\nplease dont persist\\n\\n\\nif you would please listen his hands at his sides bokuto bowed please it will only take a second\\n\\nakaashi was straightforward but he wasnt heartless he huffed out a breath and turned around what is it i really have to go\\n\\nhis eyes lighting up bokuto straightened his back and fished his hand into his pocket he pulled out a phone and to akaashis dread he asked for his phone number\\n\\nwhat was he to do what was he to say akaashi literally found nothing special about bokuto why had the sickly one taken a sudden liking to him he wanted nothing more than to push him away throw away the forms and never set foot into that hospital again but for some strange and irritating reason akaashi found it difficult to deny bokuto he was trying to he truly was but he just couldnt\\n\\ni dont usually text akaashi murmured he looked down at bokutos phone he couldnt look at his face im often busy keeping in contact with me wouldnt be a good idea\\n\\nhe watched bokutos fingers curl around the phone and his hand slowly backed away\\n\\nbut akaashi shocked himself with that one word he could still see bokutos hand and it had frozen in place i guess i could find some time to talk every so often he looked up and his gaze found bokutos those yellow eyes were gleaming\\n\\nhe entered his number swiftly and then handed the phone to bokuto the name section empty\\n\\nthank you his voice was full of excitement as he proceeded to enter the name for his new contact akaashi watched closely as bokuto mouthed and typed the name\\n\\napathykun bokuto was close to saving the contact before akaashi spoke up\\n\\nyou dont have to put that he sighed its akaashi\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nthe sky burned a strong orange glow as the sun set in the distance akaashi sat in bed laptop in his lap as his fingers scrolled and typed frantically\\n\\n\\nffi \\n\\n\\nthe page loaded akaashi went straight into the reading\\n\\nffi is a very rare autosomal dominant inherited prion disease of the brain akaashis eyes scanned the screen ffi has no known cure and involves progressively worsening insomnia which leads to hallucinations delirium and confusional states like that of dementia\\n\\nthin lips pressed into an even thinner line his fingers remained stiff for quite some time as his eyes read the introductory paragraph over and over again\\n\\nthere is no known cure huh akaashi continued to read on all the people whove contracted this disease eventually die within a year or less this part was read aloud\\n\\nhe rubbed his face quietly of course they do akaashi leaned his head on his hand chin resting in his palm\\n\\ni wonder if bokuto knows about all of this he must have looked it up at some point right it was the only normal thing to do considering how he was the one who was suffering from said disease\\n\\ninsomnia he thought back to the bags around bokutos eyes\\n\\n\\nall i can say is that sleeping doesnt come as easily as it used to \\n\\n\\nakaashi exhaled quickly through his nose making a sound that was almost like a laugh he read up on the symptoms and blinked gently a hand over his lips after several minutes akaashi closed his laptop and lay back on his bed he stared at the ceiling\\n\\nsome friend ive made\\n\\nthere wasnt much else to say\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\nnew text message\\n\\n\\nfrom bokuto sent july 29th at 1156 pm\\n\\nhey i hope this isnt a bad time\\n\\nakaashi lifted his head from his pillow and reached a hand out to grab his phone the bright light caused him to squint as he read the message quietly he contemplated on whether he wanted to respond or not he blinked weakly and slid his fingers down the sides of his phone a sign of weariness that he could not disobey akaashi watched as the screen went to black and it was then that he placed the phone back on his nightstand choosing to ignore the message\\n\\nhe couldnt sleep for about an hour after the text but ultimately slipped off to sleep\\n\\nakaashi never received another message in the remaining hour that he was awake\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nduring the next day akaashi decided to stay home he sat in his room for the majority of the day and had spent at least six hours awake until hed picked his phone up in his hands again\\n\\nhe looked at the message bokuto had sent him the night before his thumb aimlessly hovered over the keyboard thinking of what to type\\n\\nfrom akaashi sent at 443pm\\n\\nhello\\n\\nbokuto\\n\\nhey hey heyyyyy\\n\\ni must have texted you while you were asleep\\n\\nakaashi was dumbfounded hed never received a faster response in his life\\n\\nakaashi\\n\\nyeah that mustve been the case\\n\\nyou say hey a lot bokuto\\n\\nbokuto\\n\\ni know its kind of my thing\\n\\nakaashi could feel bokutos enthusiasm through his text messages he spoke to akaashi as if he hadnt had a friend to text in years\\n\\nbokuto\\n\\nhow are you today\\n\\nakaashi\\n\\nim well thank you just catching up on some volleyball things\\n\\nbokuto\\n\\nvolleyball you like volleyball too we have to play together\\n\\nwincing a bit akaashi squinted at his phone screen such an energetic texter bokuto was he was kind of difficult to keep up with and akaashi felt like this would be a long term sort of thing\\n\\nakaashi\\n\\nuh sure i mean will they let you out of the hospital\\n\\nbokuto\\n\\ni guess i can still walk around and get to where i have to go pretty much the only thing wrong with me is that i cant sleep\\n\\nakaashi scowled he could feel the ignorance emanating off of bokutos text messages did he really think he was admitted to a hospital just because he was having trouble sleeping he knew full well the name of the disease he had so then why was he so cheerful about his entire situation why did he lack the understanding of just how serious his condition was\\n\\nunless bokuto was purposely playing the fool he must have been\\n\\n\\nright \\n\\n\\nakaashis grip tightened around his phone he had to be\\n\\nakaashi\\n\\nthen i guess ill see you at the hospital around a week or two from now i know a gymnasium we can go to\\n\\nbokuto\\n\\na week or two\\n\\nakaashi\\n\\nis that too long a wait i can probably reschedule\\n\\nbokuto\\n\\nnah its alright i guess i can wait that long ive got time\\n\\nive got time the words echoed in akaashis head as if theyd been spoken aloud he stared down at the screen his brow furrowing slightly did bokuto know about the lifespan of victims with his condition was he just playing the fool after all just what kind of guy was he\\n\\nindifference morphed into curiosity and said curiosity was what drew akaashi closer to his new friend\\n\\nakaashi\\n\\ngreat ill see you then\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nakaashi\\n\\nanother two weeks had passed since akaashi had seen bokuto but this time he waited outside of the hospital several meters away from the entrance\\n\\nakaashi had looked up from his phone and stuffed it into his jacket pocket as the energetic hospital patient made his way across the lot in no time bokuto was standing in front of akaashi eager in every way to make it to the gymnasium\\n\\ni havent set foot outside in weeks he looked around the day was strangely chilly with an occasional breeze now and then causing the browning leaves to rustle in the trees above those yellow eyes examined everything adamant with taking all of it in\\n\\nbokuto tucked his hands into the pockets of his hood his shoulders hunching a puff of smoke came from him as he exhaled he was paler than before and the bags under his eyes were darker bokuto looked exhausted beyond belief yet there he stood excited to make his way to the gymnasium\\n\\nakaashi hadnt even mustered his first word before bokuto snapped his head to the side to give him his undivided attention\\n\\nthe gymnasiums about ten minutes that way akaashi pointed down the road\\n\\nthen lets go bokuto power walked ahead obligating akaashi to catch up to him with a quickened pace whether he wanted to or not\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nthe sounds of their sneakers squeaking against the gym floor was so memory inducing it caused akaashi to take a moment and reminisce on the old days as if doing so would take him back in time to when hed play volleyball every single day after school after a while he opened his eyes and sighed then moved across the court to the net hed brought along a volleyball of his own just in case they werent provided with any\\n\\nwhat used to be your position back when you would play bokuto asked aloud finally pulling his hands from his hood pockets his head was cocked back as he surveyed the gym\\n\\nakaashi bounced the ball off the floor twice setter you\\n\\nbokuto grinned i was the team captain and the ace he gave a mock swing of his arm as if spiking do you think you can toss to me\\n\\nof course\\n\\nakaashi and bokuto carried a sort of unspoken communication with each other they had a strange relationship to say the least akaashi would answer his questions coldly with little to no emotion but bokuto would cherish these answers and retort with excitement in his tone he did not seem to take offense easily bokuto was very different from everyone else akaashi had ever met before him\\n\\nwhere most people would detach themselves bokuto took hold and wouldnt let go being as persistent as he was energetic it was very unsettling akaashi turned away and frowned\\n\\n\\ni wouldnt have given you my number if you werent a patient \\n\\n\\nthe black haired male bounced the ball again and walked over to position\\n\\nthis is all so nostalgic bokutos voice was filled to the brim with excitement he took several steps back to prepare himself for the toss mentally he was more than ready to spike but not so much physically\\n\\nbokuto missed akaashis set twelve times\\n\\nshit shit his frustration was unmasked please toss to me again he threw the ball to akaashi\\n\\ntheres no stopping you is there taking the ball in his hands akaashi aimed for the approximate location as to where bokuto would spike the ball he wanted for him to spike it at least once lest bokuto threw a self hateinduced panic attack\\n\\nwatching as bokuto ran forward akaashi set the ball perfectly it brought him back to his high school days now if only the sickly one would hit it\\n\\nthe sound of the palm of bokutos hand meeting the ball sounded much like an explosion akaashi flinched it had been so long since hed heard something so loud it was amazing\\n\\nha did you see that bokuto was bursting with emotion he was ecstatic i spiked it perfectly just now that toss was perfect without hesitation he ran across the court to retrieve the ball\\n\\nakaashi knew that running probably wasnt the best thing that he should have been doing but he said nothing about it the ball was tossed back to him and again he got back to tossing the ball for bokuto\\n\\nafter three sets there was another hit and another cheer from the former ace akaashi raised his eyebrows\\n\\nimpressive he watched the ball roll further away from them and expected to see bokuto trailing it but instead saw nothing he turned his attention back to the only other in the room\\n\\nbokuto stared off in the distance from beyond the net his face carrying a confused expression after a moment quietly he spoke\\n\\nthey arent really there are they the words left his mouth reluctantly\\n\\nakaashi glanced in the direction of where bokuto was staring no one they were the only two in the gym he dug his thumb nail into the side of his index finger and returned his gaze to bokuto\\n\\nthey arent really there he had to force himself to say the mere four words\\n\\nbokuto mouthed an okay before backing up several steps could you please toss to me some more\\n\\nsure akaashi nodded once and that was all that bokuto needed to hear before he ran off to retrieve the ball\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nat some point during their walk home from the gym akaashi had agreed for bokuto to spend the night at his house\\n\\nmy parents are out for a month hed unconsciously said causing bokuto to go into a begging frenzy to stay over until akaashi said yes normally he would have been red with irritation from the sound of such irksome persistence but the smile that would claim bokutos face whenever he agreed to something would make akaashi forget all about how frustrated he was\\n\\nhe entered his home with bokuto in a matter of minutes having walked faster than usual out there the sickly one trembled like a new born animal even with the extra jacket that akaashi had offered him\\n\\nits warm bokuto exhaled and shuddered once he was inside slipping off his shoes\\n\\nakaashi stepped in and turned his head i would hope so he moved forward my room is this way\\n\\nbokuto followed briskly he observed his surroundings once again having been fascinated by the inside of someone elses home everything was neat and placed perfectly here and there giving akaashis house a warm atmosphere to it it reminded him of his home\\n\\nbokuto nearly bumped into akaashi as he stopped to enter his room\\n\\nyou can sit anywhere he climbed into bed and folded one leg pulling over his laptop to start it up\\n\\nis your bed alright bokuto pulled off akaashis jacket\\n\\ni said anywhere\\n\\nbokuto plopped onto the mattress right after those words bumping his head against akaashis shoulder he recoiled with a grunt\\n\\nwatch it akaashi shifted to the side to give his visitor more room despite this bokuto was still close enough for their arms to touch akaashi sighed and lazily dragged his finger along the dpad do you want to watch a movie\\n\\nbokuto curled in on himself and pushed his hands into his hood pocket yeah anything is fine his yellow eyes stared at the screen intently\\n\\nokay akaashi opened the first movie that he had in his computers memory he pushed the laptop away and pressed play\\n\\nwhats it called confused bokuto glanced over at him\\n\\ncloud atlas\\n\\nhow long is it\\n\\nabout three hours he kicked his legs out of bed and walked across his room to retrieve a thick blanket that sat bundled up in a rolling chair he then tossed it to bokuto once he was close enough youve been shivering use it\\n\\nbokuto gathered the navy blue blanket in his arms and cautiously threw it around his shoulders it was soft thank you he kept his eyes on the screen i used to handle the cold better than this an embarrassed chuckle escaped him\\n\\nexhaling through his nostrils akaashi reclaimed his seat in bed crossing his legs things happen\\n\\nyeah\\n\\noutside the sky above grew dark as clouds rolled in bokuto quieted himself curled up and watched on as the movie started\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nthe sound of rain pelting hard against the window snapped akaashi back into reality he looked around in weary haste but calmed quickly once his memory had returned to him hed nodded off for a brief moment with his arms crossed and his head resting on a thick bundle of pillows with much effort he sat up to look at bokuto\\n\\nthe movie was well over two hours in nearing its end and bokuto lay on his side curled up and clutching the blanket with what little strength he had left his eyes were halflidded and glued to the screen his face void of emotion it almost looked as if he were asleep\\n\\nbokuto akaashis voice was groggy\\n\\nslowly his yellow eyes scrolled to the side to catch akaashis gaze he turned his head weakly and his body along with it\\n\\nim sorry ive watched this movie so many times i actually fell asleep akaashi dragged a hand down his face\\n\\ndont be sorry bokuto found himself smiling its your house you sleep if you want to\\n\\nnot if i have a visitor over\\n\\nits fine im not just some visitor after all were friends bokutos head lolled to the side directing his attention back to the movie you were out for about an hour\\n\\nakaashi heaved a sigh he rubbed the back of his neck\\n\\ni envy you i wish i could sleep like that again\\n\\nguilt bubbled up within akaashis chest hed realized just how rude that was falling asleep so easily in front of a person whos biggest struggle was just that\\n\\nhow insensitive of me he furrowed his brow mentally scolding himself\\n\\ndont cry over it bokuto shifted as he lay down sticking a leg out to kick akaashi the movie kept me company its very good kind of confusing but good ill have to watch it again\\n\\nstrange bokuto was such a strange one he seemed to be unfazed by many things and blatant about others blurting sentences out that didnt seem to have much thought behind them akaashi doubted that hed ever have bokuto over again so hearing him say ill have to watch it again didnt sit too well with him\\n\\nakaashi twisted his lips to the side and decided to bring up something else are you tired\\n\\nexhausted bokuto answered honestly\\n\\nclose your eyes for the time being akaashi kicked his legs out of bed with much effort and stood on his feet ill get us some water he left the room quickly leaving bokuto by his lonesome\\n\\nafter several seconds hed returned to see that bokuto had changed his position in bed entirely he lay on his back with his head on some of akaashis pillows his hands rested on his stomach the dark blanket surrounding him from behind but slipping off just enough for his torso to be exposed his head rested against the bed slumped to the side facing away from akaashi\\n\\nagain if he hadnt known any better akaashi would have figured that bokuto was already fast asleep he approached his bedside silently the room was dark apart from the soft orange glow that his lamp gave off\\n\\nhe set the drinks down and shuffled into bed as if trying not to wake the other lying on his back he stared at the ceiling\\n\\nno words were exchanged for what seemed like forever before akaashi spoke up\\n\\nhow does it feel to not be able to sleep\\n\\nbokutos answer was delayed awful he turned his head in the opposite direction facing akaashi now i can barely keep my eyes open by day and can barely keep them closed by night he snorted in laughter\\n\\ndoes it frustrate you\\n\\nit did at first when i didnt understand why but now im kind of okay with it a hand reached up to push through his own messy locks i still miss it though sleeping dreaming\\n\\nakaashi watched bokuto listening to every word he said\\n\\ni used to have some insane dreams too especially before certain volleyball matches he laughed again louder this time id dream that i messed up during a spike and then id wake up fuming and would constantly tell myself that i was the best\\n\\ndo you still think that you are the best emerald eyes searched bokutos own for an honest answer\\n\\nhe sighed his response with a grin yeah bokuto closed his eyes after that one hand resting on the side of his head he was obviously tired showing signs of exhaustion with every small move he made\\n\\nakaashi grew silent and knitted his fingers together on his stomach his head relaxing into his pillow the both of them didnt exchange any words after that ending the conversation just as suddenly as it had started\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\ntwo hours had passed since their last words towards each other yet akaashi still lay awake in bed unknown to bokuto he watched him quietly through almost closed eyelids his thick lashes being enough to hide the fact that he was still awake tired but awake\\n\\nakaashi couldnt sleep but it wasnt because of his unfamiliarity with bokuto that caused this he couldnt sleep because of his honest fascination with him\\n\\nbokuto would lay still for quite a while his head tilted to the side with one hand on his stomach and the other at his side when he was like this akaashi would think that he was resting and he would almost believe that thought until bokuto would twitch awake again his body jerking him from what little relaxation he tried to achieve\\n\\nat first akaashi thought nothing of it bokuto would wince and snap back to reality the way someone would when they dreamt they were falling but akaashi knew full well that such a thing wasnt possible with bokutos condition it made akaashi pity him to say the least\\n\\nthree times bokuto jolted awake involuntarily and three times he covered his eyes with his forearm and heaved a quiet sigh akaashi refused to have reacted to those moments hoping to spare his visitor the embarrassment of him having seen that he intended on closing his eyes and falling asleep for real afterwards but after having felt his mattress shake for the fourth time he opened his eyes\\n\\nakaashi lifted himself onto his elbows bokuto he whispered\\n\\nalarmed he snapped around quickly his face looked both shocked and exhausted at the same time akaashi im\\n\\ndont his voice a mere murmur akaashi moved closer to bokuto then resumed to lie down on his back his head slightly elevated with the pillows that sat behind him dont apologize\\n\\nmildly embarrassed bokuto looked away and rubbed his arms\\n\\ncome akaashi beckoned for his visitor\\n\\nturning his attention back to him bokuto met akaashis gaze he wore a confused expression wondering just what the other had meant by that word\\n\\ni said come he motioned for bokuto to come closer get over here as akaashi said this he held out an arm as if readying himself for some sort of hug\\n\\nobeying with hesitance bokuto shifted towards akaashi and lay against him fitting into the curve of his arm it was no doubt that he was larger than akaashi but that didnt stop him from fitting in just right\\n\\nbokutos head lay against akaashis shoulder akaashis arm cautiously wrapped itself around bokutos broad shoulders\\n\\nneither of them said a word\\n\\nminutes passed and in time akaashi could feel bokuto relaxing against him the signs of fatigue finally wearing him down his head slumped against his shoulder and both his hands rested on his stomach he was trying trying so hard to fit in that small amount of sleep that would get him through the next day and akaashi wanted to help\\n\\nas much as he didnt want to believe it akaashi wanted so badly to help\\n\\n\\nwhy \\n\\n\\nakaashi watched as one of bokutos hands twitched involuntarily and to his dismay it wouldnt stop slowly he reached a hand out and closed it over the twitching one his four fingers fitting into bokutos palm in seconds his hand was calm again\\n\\nakaashi inhaled quietly he watched as bokutos chest rose and fell with each breath that kept him alive his breathing was controlled much like one of a persons who was actually asleep pursing his lips akaashi let his head fall back into the pillows he turned his head to the side towards bokutos he could smell his faint scent he smelled sort of like a hospital\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nakaashi made his way to the hospital for the umpteenth time that week his hands in his jacket pockets and his nose burying into the burgundy knit scarf that protected him from the chilly weather\\n\\nit had been two months since bokutos visit over his home and ever since then akaashi found that making his way to the hospital had become a daily routine for him and even if he didnt show up he would still spend his days sending messages to bokuto be it text email or the occasional video chat\\n\\nhe exhaled through his nose and entered the hospital greeted the woman at the front desk who now knew him by name and removed the scarf from around his neck akaashi already knew where he had to go\\n\\nhe ascended those familiar steps said hello to the familiar faces and rounded that familiar corner that he knew would lead him to bokutos room another breath escaped him slow and casual but hed soon learned to hold his breath when he noticed another person sitting outside in the hall several feet from the room where visitors could spend their time\\n\\nakaashi eyeballed the small male for a long second knowing that he wouldnt look up to catch him his head hung low and his attention belonged only to the handheld system that entertained him\\n\\nnormally akaashi would have walked away that instant in order to pay bokuto a visit but as he neared his room he could hear two voices coming from within one of the voices belonged to bokuto the other he had no clue akaashi paused and gripped the strap of his bag hesitating he turned pivoting on one foot to stare back at the small one who sat by his lonesome feeling that it would be rude to interrupt bokutos conversation with whoever the other person was akaashi strode over to the seats and sat one chair away from the gaming stranger\\n\\nakaashi tapped his fingers quietly against his pants\\n\\n are you here to see bokuto koutarou akaashis asked in a leveled tone\\n\\nno my friend is the other spoke in a quiet voice low and brooding or maybe not brooding but more along the lines of apathetic\\n\\napathykun the nickname popped into akaashis head for a brief second he wasnt too sure why\\n\\nis your friend a friend of bokutos\\n\\nyeah an old friend he pressed pause on his psp and tapped one end of it against his open palm they used to play volleyball together they go back a couple of years\\n\\nakaashi leaned back in his seat ah i see he felt the need to keep most of his questions at bay his company did not seem like the type to socialize so openly so he figured simple inquiries would do just fine especially if he kept them to a minimum\\n\\nmay i ask your name akaashi took a shot at it\\n\\na small thumb rubbed at the systems screen to remove a smudge he looked up gazed at akaashi past his bleached blonde bangs and straightened his back in the slightest way possible\\n\\nkozume kenma\\n\\nakaashi keiji he felt like he could enjoy kozumes company what with how his words lacked all form of emotion its nice to meet you kozume\\n\\nkenma is fine he looked back down at the game screen likewise\\n\\nakaashi nodded glad to have made an acquaintance and would have relaxed into his seat if not for the sudden disembodied voice that startled him soon after kenmas sentence\\n\\nhey kenma who are you talking to as if straight from a cartoon out popped a tall male from bokutos room with stark black hair that both hung over his face and stuck out in all directions he carried a look on his face that made him seem more sinister than sincere and his eyes flitted from kenma to akaashi and then back to kenma\\n\\nthis is akaashi i just met him his words were as straightforward as they were indifferent\\n\\nakaashi bokutos voice rang out from the room this time akaashi didnt even have to see his face to know that bokuto was beaming hes here is he here\\n\\ni am akaashi rose from his seat to enter the room but instead found bokuto standing at the door in seconds his eyes wide with surprise he was thinner than before a large flannel shirt fitting him loosely he had probably lost a bit overtwenty pounds in the two months that passed\\n\\nakaashi frowned get back into bed you shouldnt be\\n\\nbokuto didnt allow him to finish his sentence as he embraced akaashi suddenly i didnt think you were going to make it today though hed gotten thinner his arms still had some power to them he squeezed akaashi mashing him closer until he could barely breathe\\n\\nakaashis eyebrows knit together i told you i would he all but murmured against bokutos shoulder\\n\\nwhats this the taller dark haired male gestured to them i come to visit and im barely paid attention to but when he comes along hes given the whole package\\n\\nbokuto pulled away to face his smirking friend relax he then turned his attention to akaashi this is kuroo a close friend of mine\\n\\nhe cocked his head to the side nice to meet you akaashi ive heard a lot about you in the short hour that ive been here\\n\\nnodding once akaashi acknowledged kuroos words but did not know how to respond to them all he had to offer was a the pleasure is mine before moving forward to try and usher bokuto back into his room\\n\\nhey hey bokuto resisted standing firm in place we were actually just talking about stepping outside\\n\\nwell i brought it up just as a suggestion but then he got really excited kuroo scratched the back of his head so we were going to step outside for a minute or two in order to get this owl to shut up\\n\\nive been cooped up in this place for too long i havent gone outside in days the discomfort could be heard in bokutos voice if there was one thing that akaashi had learned about bokuto in the little time that hed known him it was that he wasnt too fond of staying locked up indoors maybe taking him outside for a while would do him some good\\n\\nakaashi looked down the hall lets go then to the garden out in the back\\n\\neveryone came to an unspoken agreement after the one sentence kuroo started down the hall bokuto trailing after him akaashi followed after knowing that kenma was nearby as he walked he stared at the backs of the two men in front of him they both seemed to be the same height but akaashi couldnt help but realize that bokuto looked just a bit smaller\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\na mere two minutes outside had turned into two hours\\n\\nakaashi shared a bench with kenma the both of them had sat down long ago leaving bokuto and kuroo to their own business as they wandered about and waved their arms around in their animated way of speaking he found it strange how bokuto was the one walking around when he was the sick one out of the lot he furrowed his brow and exhaled heavily his eyes looking down he stared at his knees intensely before kenma spoke up\\n\\nyou dont like to see him like that do you\\n\\nakaashi lifted his head and looked to his side he eyed the blonde one for quite a while kenma didnt give him a chance to respond\\n\\ni dont like to see him like that either its why i didnt want to come along but kuroo insisted kenmas unconcerned tone contradicted his words but something told akaashi that he meant everything he was saying\\n\\nwere you ever friends with bokuto akaashi lifted his head in subtle interest\\n\\nmore like acquaintances our teams would face each other often whenever we did kuroo and bokuto would meet up afterwards and spend time together im usually around kuroo so he shrugged with little energy i sort of got to know him through kuroos company hes an okay guy loud though\\n\\nbokutos disembodied laughter rang throughout the garden as if to prove kenma right\\n\\nakaashi almost smiled so how are you taking all of this if i may ask\\n\\nim kenmas lips puckered in thought im taking it well or at least i think i am im trying to detach myself its another reason why i didnt want to pay bokuto any visits he looked down his hair hanging over his face theres something about bokuto that doesnt sit well with me\\n\\nconfused and mildly shocked akaashi made a face is there something wrong with him has he ever done anything bad\\n\\nnot to my knowledge but even if he has thats not what i meant kenma rubbed his nose with his sleeve it doesnt matter if youve never met bokuto before or if you havent seen him in ten days or ten weeks or ten months or ten years if you ever interact with him in even the slightest youll be reminded of just how good a person he really is\\n\\nakaashi stared at kenma speechless\\n\\nhes genuine kind and at times infantile but thats what makes him so likeable i suppose he drags you back in he praises others while shouting that hes the best at everything he does its ridiculous\\n\\nlooking away slowly akaashi watched as bokuto and kuroo reappeared in the distance they were still wrapped up in whatever conversation they were having\\n\\nkuroo looks happy now but he wasnt then kenma almost murmured the words akaashi turned to catch a glimpse of him but he stared off in the distance his eyes not focusing on anything in particular blinking akaashi turned his attention back to kuroo and bokuto\\n\\nfive weeks ago he was in shambles he didnt want to talk to anyone he only accepted my company i was the only one willing to give it to him he continued to stare on as he talked that was when he learned about the disease this entire past month hasnt been any different for him though he almost didnt want to come today either no one likes to find out that someone they care about is sick much less diagnosed with a disease that cant be cured\\n\\nbokuto and kuroo continued to talk animatedly the both of them out of earshot\\n\\nbokuto is starting to look less and less like his old self too he used to be thicker he used to be bigger than kuroo but now hes the one whos smaller kuroos the bigger one kuroos the heavier one it doesnt it doesnt make any sense\\n\\npursing his lips into a thin line akaashi looked down and noticed that kenma had laced his fingers together he pulled and tugged at them restlessly his hands showed what his face dared not\\n\\nakaashi figured it was safe to say that bokuto had already begun to pull kenma back in it was an awful thing to do but akaashi knew full well that none of it was intentional on bokutos part all he had to do was talk to someone and in an instant they would be involved in bokutos lively shenanigans once again\\n\\nakaashi knew this the same thing happened to him some two and a half months ago if he had known that sending simple text messages would have turned into daily hospital visits then he would have never handed over his cell number this was not what he wanted he wanted healthy friends that he could talk to on a regular basis not one sick friend who hed have to invest personal and emotional time into akaashi swallowed thickly and crossed his hands rubbing one thumb over the other he stared at bokuto and found it difficult to look away with a heavy heart he spoke\\n\\ni wish i never met him\\n\\na cool breeze passed through the garden just then and in the distance bokuto held on tight to the burgundy knit scarf around his neck to keep warm\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nin time kuroo and kenma found that it was time for them to make their way back home kuroo bid bokuto farewell for the time being while kenma made his way downstairs to exit the building he didnt seem like one to say goodbye  or hello  for that matter so both akaashi and bokuto didnt pay any mind to it\\n\\nkuroo finally left the room after four minutes or so having forgotten that he was supposed to leave in the first place he waved and jogged out knowing that if he didnt hurry hed have to spend several more minutes trying to catch up to a wandering kenma\\n\\nstanding at the side of bokutos bed akaashi glanced to the open door that led to the hallway\\n\\nyour friend is a lot like you\\n\\nanything but bokuto retorted sitting upright in bed hes a bit more of an ass to say the least he chuckled and rubbed at his face wearily\\n\\nthe sound of bokutos laughter caused akaashi to turn his head back to him it was a reaction that akaashi was not expecting in the least but he played off his surprise and only managed an i see\\n\\nbokuto gazed at akaashi almost in wonder why are you standing take a seat he pat the empty space next to him animatedly\\n\\nno its alright i was actually thinking of taking my leave soon as well\\n\\nwhat why the disappointment in his voice was clear youve only been here for like thirty minutes\\n\\nakaashi scratched his head its been over three hours actually\\n\\nthats the same thing bokuto moved closer to where akaashi was standing all the while still sitting in bed i spoke to kuroo most of the time so it doesnt count\\n\\nwhat doesnt akaashi took an unnoticeable step back\\n\\nthe three hours he was getting frustrated im very bad at measuring time now too if you havent noticed three hours feels like seven hours sometimes but three hours can also feel like seven minutes i may not be as sharp as i used to but that whole time flies when youre having fun rule still applies to me even today\\n\\nso three hours is nothing akaashi muttered\\n\\nexactly bokutos eyes lit up again\\n\\nakaashi avoided looking into them i understand but i still have to go he avoided looking at bokuto altogether i would stay if it were up to me ive just got something to take care of but ill be sure to visit you tomorrow\\n\\nbokuto didnt make a sound he pressed his lips into a thin line and fell backwards on his bed he probably had a thousand things to say but he kept them all at bay and instead rolled onto his side facing away from akaashi\\n\\nhe was shocked akaashi never knew that bokuto was one to suddenly sulk on a dime he looked around and frowned and figured it would be best to take his leave\\n\\nill see you tomorrow\\n\\ndo you want your scarf back the question came out of the blue despite him being the one who asked bokuto held onto it tightly\\n\\nakaashi watched him and zipped up his jacket yeah i do\\n\\nin dismay bokuto sat up in bed and slowly reached around his neck to pull off the warm piece of cloth he took his time the thought of removing it killing him faster than the disease itself\\n\\nbut i also want you to hold onto it\\n\\nthe words had come as such a shock to bokuto that hed paused and looked up at akaashi his hands tensed relaxed and rested against his neck you do\\n\\nyes akaashi managed the faintest of smiles please hold onto it bokuto\\n\\nat that moment he turned away and walked off feeling he wouldnt be able to leave if hed lasted one more second in the room\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nakaashi woke with a start that same night his strangled shouts having pulled him from his sleep hed flinched hard and sat up quickly closing his hand over his mouth to subdue the almost hysteric sounds that came from him his breathing was heavy his heart rate quicker than usual akaashi could feel his heart pounding in his throat making it difficult to swallow\\n\\nsh shit\\n\\nthat had been the fifth time that month where akaashi had to tear himself out of another nightmare they made him feel nauseous to a point where he had to sit up in bed and swallow deep slow breaths in order to cool himself down and he did just that reaching his hands up to rub at his eyes before taking a tense look around his room\\n\\nexhaling heavily akaashi turned to look at the desk near his bed his phone was there hesitating for only a second he reached his hand out and took the device into his hands when the screen lit up a text message from bokuto waited there for him\\n\\nsleep well akaashi it had been sent two hours ago\\n\\nakaashi swiped and unlocked his phone with trembling hands\\n\\nfrom akaashi sent at 247am\\n\\nare you there\\n\\nbokuto\\n\\nyeah akaashi i thought you fell asleep\\n\\nakaashi had to wait almost a minute for bokutos response it was the longest minute hed ever been forced to sit through\\n\\nakaashi\\n\\ni woke up nightmares\\n\\nbokuto\\n\\nnightmare you had a nightmare was it bad\\n\\nakaashi\\n\\nwell it managed to wake me up\\n\\nbokuto\\n\\nthe quiet kind of wake up\\n\\nakaashi\\n\\nno more like the cliched kind where you sit up in bed in a cold sweat\\n\\nbokuto\\n\\nare you calming down are you feeling better\\n\\nakaashi stared at the text message and let out a shaking sigh judging by his still trembling hands he knew he wasnt\\n\\nakaashi\\n\\nyeah im just a little shaken\\n\\nbokuto\\n\\ni dont believe you on that yeah part\\n\\nakaashi\\n\\nim fine\\n\\nbokuto\\n\\nalright well well just see about that\\n\\nfurrowing his brow akaashi stared at his phone screen and lay his head down sideways it wasnt like bokuto to question what he said in such a straightforward fashion\\n\\nakaashi\\n\\ntheres nothing to see\\n\\nhe pressed send and watched the phone carefully waiting for the small ellipses to appear on the lower left side of the screen but instead he was greeted with nothing he didnt get a response nor did he see any signs of responding\\n\\nakaashi frowned and left his phone screen alone to dim and blacken he held it in his shaking hands and closed his eyes in an attempt to try and find sleep again it was difficult however as each time he tried to drift off to sleep that unnerving fear of having the same dream would jerk him back awake akaashi groaned softly and covered his face\\n\\n\\n\\nbzzt\\n\\n\\n\\nakaashis phone vibrated against his forehead he flinched and pulled his hand away to stare at the screen\\n\\nbokuto\\n\\nlook outside no\\n\\nwhat akaashi kicked his legs out of bed and strode to his window impossible he pulled apart the blinds and looked down\\n\\nout in the dead of night stood bokuto with the burgundy knit scarf around his neck a jacket jeans and slippers he looked up and grinned and waved wildly in akaashis direction\\n\\nakaashis eyes widened no no no no he pulled away from the windowsill and ran out of his room straight downstairs and to the front door he threw it open and faced bokuto who was jogging to him with a smile and a shiver in each step\\n\\nmay i come in\\n\\nno no were\\n\\nwhy not\\n\\nwere going back to the hospital right now im taking you back akaashi reached his arms out and pushed bokuto away\\n\\nwhat no bokuto refused to budge he pushed akaashi back this time i just came from there\\n\\nexactly because you belong there akaashi felt that his words were a bit bitter but he had no other way of telling bokuto the truth youre sick you need medical attention\\n\\nso i cant sleep bokuto swatted akaashis hands away whats the big deal\\n\\nits more than that he exerted more force into his arms getting bokuto to take a step back youve had two panic attacks this week already and your hallucinations are getting worse my home is not a place for you to be right now\\n\\ni get panic attacks when youre not around bokuto answered simplemindedly and my hallucinations arent all that bad\\n\\nakaashi clenched his jaw behind a mildly irritated face stop trying to act like this isnt such a big deal you may not think it is but i he paused and reached his arms out to get in another shove lets just go\\n\\ni dont want to bokuto grabbed akaashis hands with his own\\n\\nbokuto stop\\n\\ni dont want to go back\\n\\nhow did you even sneak out\\n\\nby sneaking out they dont pay much attention to me anyways\\n\\nakaashi yanked his hands away and stared at bokuto as much as it infuriated him he knew that bokuto wasnt going to go anywhere unless he let him into his home first he swallowed thickly\\n\\nget inside akaashi stepped to the side\\n\\nbokutos eyes did the familiar light up thing as he bounded into akaashis home he removed his slippers and waited at the entrance for his friend to enter akaashi stepped in and shut the door behind him\\n\\nyou chose the perfect night akaashi said bitterly as he hobbled up the stairs my parents arent home\\n\\nits not like i wouldve made any noise bokuto all but shouted following after him\\n\\nakaashi sighed ill get you back to the hospital by seven in the morning\\n\\nfine by me imagine the looks on their faces when they see me coming in from the outside imagine their faces when they notice im not even in my room bokuto was elated\\n\\nakaashi entered his room and shut the door behind bokuto im going straight to sleep\\n\\nbut i thought you had that nightmare bokuto stood at the side of akaashis bed\\n\\ni did he paused for a moment  is that why you came here because of the nightmare\\n\\nbokuto stared at akaashi because you said you were okay and i knew you werent\\n\\nakaashi was at a loss for words he returned bokutos gaze then looked down quickly afterwards a hand tugged at his shirt weakly i see he reached a hand out to turn on the lamp that sat on his nightstand\\n\\ntaking a seat on the edge of the bed bokuto rubbed the back of his neck what was the dream about\\n\\nakaashi sat in bed and wrapped a sheet around himself he tossed the navy blue one to bokuto remembering how fond he was of it the last time hed come over he watched as bokuto gathered it up in his arms and threw it around himself he then stared at akaashi waiting for his response\\n\\nhe sighed i was drowning his hands picked at the small lint rolls that stuck to his sheet drowning in something black sort of like tar i was fighting and trying to get out but i had no power over it whatsoever i was so weak and itd gotten to the point where i could barely breath my face was the only thing sticking out akaashi cocked his head back to demonstrate this with his finger tapping his chin\\n\\ni was struggling but in the end i couldnt move i was shouting but no sound came out no one could hear me no one was around akaashi shrugged the liquid started flooding into my mouth and nose and it wasnt until i was suffocating that i forced myself awake\\n\\nakaashi didnt say another word afterwards he only bundled himself up in the sheets that surrounded him he turned his head to look out the window eyeing the moon timidly\\n\\nshifting in his seat bokuto pulled himself closer to akaashi one hand grasping the blanket that had been given to him\\n\\nakaashi remained in place with the thought in mind that bokuto would respect his personal space and sit a foot or two away from him but to his apparent surprise bokuto leaned his head on akaashis shoulder and slipped an arm around him\\n\\nakaashi squirmed in discomfort what are you doing\\n\\ncomforting bokuto replied lifting his head isnt that what humans do\\n\\nakaashi watched him carefully dont talk like youre not one\\n\\nbokuto chortled quietly and placed his head back on akaashis shoulder they didnt speak for a moment and the room was filled with the hushed sounds of the outside\\n\\nhey\\n\\nwhat\\n\\nlets watch cloud atlas\\n\\nno akaashi shook his head\\n\\nbokuto grumbled to himself why not dont you have it in your laptop\\n\\ni do but i dont want to watch it its a long movie and ive watched it about seven times already\\n\\nwell if youve watched it seven times then why not watch it an eighth time\\n\\nbecause its three in the morning and i want to fit some sleep into my schedule by the time that movie ends itll be six then ill have to walk you to the hospital before the doctors find out youre missing and lose their minds\\n\\na laugh escaped bokuto the sound curling his lips into a smile what if theyve already found out\\n\\nthen that would be a problem\\n\\nand then theyd turn my room upside down in an attempt to find me\\n\\nthatd be a tough mess to clean up\\n\\nturning his head bokuto looked at akaashi everything you say is so straightforward why is that\\n\\ni dont know akaashi inhaled slowly its just how i am sometimes i think im funny but people never laugh at my jokes\\n\\nbokuto snorted when have you ever tried to make a joke\\n\\nwhen i said that it would be a tough mess for them to clean up akaashi sounded genuinely confused didnt that come off as remotely funny\\n\\nbokuto couldnt help but guffaw his head tilting back that was your idea of a joke\\n\\nyoure too loud be quiet akaashi shoved his visitor lightly despite this it only seemed to make bokuto laugh even harder akaashi pursed his lips in frustration but this look quickly vanished as a small laugh fell from his lips\\n\\nwell youre laughing now he tried to hide his smile so i guess i am pretty good at being funny\\n\\nbokuto glanced at him yeah but for all the wrong reasons his laughter died down along with akaashis you know i dont think ive ever heard you laugh or seen you smile for that matter\\n\\nshrugging one shoulder akaashi grabbed his phone well now you have\\n\\nbokuto looked over at the phone screen what are you doing\\n\\nsetting an alarm for six am akaashi set his phone down and leaned back slowly resting the back of his head against his pillow bokuto followed his arm still around him\\n\\nthis is strange he stared up at the ceiling and sighed why do i let him do this \\n\\nakaashis head slumped to the side in bokutos direction\\n\\ni hope you dont mind me sleeping he whispered the words\\n\\nof course i dont i showed up to your house unannounced at three in the morning youve got all the right to sleep\\n\\ni just hope it isnt rude\\n\\nit isnt bokutos arm unconsciously squeezed akaashi closer to his side\\n\\nalright he closed his eyes good night akaashi pulled his arms in close wrapping the sheets around himself\\n\\nsee you in three hours bokuto whispered\\n\\ncomplete and utter silence befell them afterwards akaashi had kept his eyes closed for quite a while trying to fall into a deep sleep but found that he couldnt or at least not as quickly as he thought he could he kept his breathing controlled and steady for about forty minutes he looked sound asleep but was actually drifting between the real world and the dream realm\\n\\nthere was silence and then there was a sound a subtle gentle sound the sound of someone cautiously moving their arm when they didnt wish to wake someone\\n\\nakaashi remained in his faux sleeping position feeling that it would take much more of an effort for him to open his eyes and check around than to stay dormant and so he continued to try and grasp sleep expecting nothing from the noise\\n\\nit was because of this that he was so surprised when he felt a gentle sensation against his forehead it took all of his power not to flinch when hed felt the unfamiliar touch\\n\\nthey were fingers hesitant fingers that ghosted over akaashis forehead in order to push a loose strand of hair away\\n\\nkeeping his eyes closed akaashi took in the feeling of this he could sense the heavy amount of reluctance in each movement that bokutos hand carried out\\n\\nbokuto was afraid to wake akaashi so much so that his hands trembled slightly whenever hed push akaashis bangs away\\n\\nslowly but gradually akaashis heart rate picked up his hands twitched once and he moved closer leaning into bokutos touch this backfired however as the others hand quickly withdrew akaashi relaxed then keeping the sleeping act alive\\n\\nbokuto did not move a muscle after having seen akaashi stir the last thing he wanted to do was wake him up so they lay in silence for minutes on end akaashi figured that bokuto would keep to himself for the rest of the night so he put his focus back to trying to sleep he held the same position and felt himself dozing off\\n\\nim sorry the words were barely a whisper and they came without warning it almost sounded as if bokuto were talking to himself\\n\\nakaashi remained still and silent\\n\\n i never meant to drag you into my life\\n\\nbokuto inhaled all that he could akaashi felt his chest rise he could practically hear the frown in his voice\\n\\ni know that im unbearable i know that im a lost cause i know that you know that too and yet you still stick by me\\n\\nhe paused for a moment then spoke up again his voice was a soft tremor\\n\\nso thank you\\n\\nbokuto had nothing more to say after that he lay his cheek on the top of akaashis head and kept still daring not to wake him\\n\\nbut akaashi now couldnt find it in himself to sleep bokutos words haunted him and they repeated themselves over and over in his mind \\n\\nhe swallowed once hoping to get rid of the lump in his throat\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nafter that night things had only gone downhill from then\\n\\nakaashi took a glance out the window only to instantly throw on his clothes and toss his bag over his shoulders he jogged downstairs slipped his shoes on and was out the door in seconds making his way down the familiar route to the hospital above the clouds were dense and they gathered quickly casting a dark shroud over akaashis path he zipped his jacket up to shield himself from the harsh winds that came his way and advanced forward there was definitely a storm coming his way so akaashi knew that bokuto would need him\\n\\na month and sixteen days had passed since bokutos final visit to akaashis home and once hed been taken back to the hospital the doctors and nurses made sure to keep a closer eye on him and with good reason not only was bokuto the kind of guy to sneak out when no one was watching but his condition had quickly begun to worsen without warning before then he would normally lose several pounds a week but ever since the night hed snuck out his weight loss could only be described as alarming in the span of a little over a month bokuto had gone from a general onehundred and fifty pounds to a mere ninetyseven pounds last time theyd weighed him the drastic weight loss was awful enough but as if to add insult to injury bokutos worsening condition also made it increasingly difficult for him to walk move and speak\\n\\nakaashi frowned heavily as he entered the hospital he made his way up the same path walking swiftly and without pause that was until he saw a familiar face\\n\\nkuroo akaashi stopped in his tracks in front of bokutos room\\n\\nthe black haired male looked up from his hands he faked a smile hey akaashi right long time\\n\\nyeah im he turned his head is there someone in there he didnt wait for kuroo to respond and glanced into bokutos room surely enough he noticed kenma sitting in the seat next to bokutos bed his back was facing the door and bokuto seemed to have all of his attention on him\\n\\nwill kenma allow me to enter the room\\n\\nkuroo rubbed the lower part of his face with his hand nope he leaned back in his chair take a seat kenma usually isnt the kind of person to speak to people one on one so i think youd better leave em both alone\\n\\ninhaling deeply akaashi lingered in place then sat down in the empty seat next to kuroo\\n\\nyou seem a bit anxious kuroo looked at akaashi sideways\\n\\ni am theres a storm coming bokuto doesnt do well with those\\n\\nah kuroo looked at the ceiling as if he would be able to see the clouds from there i hadnt noticed that one was rolling in he slowly lowered his head and folded his arms didnt think you knew that about him\\n\\nakaashi turned his head to face kuroo was he ever fond of them\\n\\ndont think so in the past hed always get sort of tense and paranoid whenever a storm would pass over head but that was kind of it now i bet he suffers panic attacks because of them\\n\\nakaashi looked down he does storms trigger them\\n\\nkuroo made a grunting noise and had nothing more to say on the subject akaashi figured he should stay quiet too he knit his fingers together and kept his eyes down anticipating when the first boom of thunder would sound he would have to close bokutos blinds and take his mind off of it somehow show him a movie or play a game with him that would result in him to calm down quickly akaashi rubbed the back of his neck hastily and closed his eyes\\n\\nninetyseven fucking pounds\\n\\nstartled akaashi opened his eyes and glanced in kuroos direction he glowered at nothing in particular\\n\\nim sorry\\n\\nninetyseven pounds right thats how much he supposedly weighs now\\n\\nonce akaashi realized what kuroo was talking about he instantly felt his spirits fall yes\\n\\nfucking bullshit he swore without a filter\\n\\nwincing akaashi turned his head away hed only spoken to kuroo once before and they barely exchanged any words he didnt know how to deal with him now so he remained silent he twisted his fingers and pursed his lips wary of what kuroo would say next\\n\\nall of this is so ugh why the hell did this have to happen to him and at such an early damn age too he hissed the words under his breath openly frustrated with the situation he turned twenty only three months ago\\n\\nakaashi lowered his head its not fair\\n\\nits not kuroo echoed the words in agreement but here we are and here he is\\n\\nkuroo rubbed his elbow irate and sighed in defeat\\n\\nim not coming back to visit him anymore not after this ive seen enough he turned to look at akaashi keep him company from now on i dont know how you do it but when youre around him you help him forget\\n\\nakaashi kept his eyes down he wouldnt show this but kuroos words had hit him harder than he could ever imagine they sat heavily in the pit of his stomach churning and pestering him urging him to throw up but he only swallowed and kept his composure just as hed been doing since the day he met bokuto\\n\\nakaashi reached his hand up to rub the back of his neck roughly administering a feeling of discomfort to one area in order to ignore the pain that threatened to swallow his heart he closed his eyes in a slow blink and kept his breathing quiet\\n\\nhaving been neck deep in his own sorrows kuroo was blind to akaashis he forced himself to stand after some time tapping his fingers against his pants\\n\\nkeep doing what youre doing his voice was low\\n\\nakaashi nodded in response\\n\\nof course i couldnt stop even if i tried\\n\\na biting chuckle escaped kuroo\\n\\nyeah aint that the horror of it all he rubbed his chin and stalked his way down the hall keep in touch akaashi\\n\\nof course he repeated the same phrase finding that it was difficult to search for words at the time he watched as kuroo walked away far enough for small details to become blurred he only looked like a tall thin black mass now as he stood near the stairway he was waiting for kenma but akaashi wondered why he hadnt waited for him in the seat that he was initially sitting in\\n\\njust then as akaashi bit down on the inside of his lower lip he turned his head in time to catch a glimpse of kenma lowering his head towards bokuto it wasnt necessarily a bow it seemed more along the lines of an act of affection or at least as affectionate as kenma could get which wasnt much\\n\\nhe touched his forehead to bokutos shoulder which only earned a laugh from him bokuto talked quietly in response to kenma gave a nod and smiled\\n\\nhe never seemed to stop smiling\\n\\nonce he saw this kenma picked himself up from his seat put his hands at his side and bowed his head he didnt last another second in bokutos company before he turned and briskly walked out of the room he kept his head down and played the fool pretending he didnt see akaashi in seconds kenma was down the hall and making his way down the stairs having completely ignored kuroo as well\\n\\nkuroo didnt seem surprised in the slightest he only waved goodbye at a staring akaashi before following his small friend down the stairs\\n\\nhesitantly akaashi barely managed to wave back before he heard his name being called from that all too familiar room by that all too familiar voice\\n\\nhe directed his attention to a grinning bokuto who eagerly sat up in bed\\n\\nakaashi almost smiled back and he would have too if it hadnt been for the thunder that sounded its arrival from above he watched as bokutos smile faded instantly his eyes having gone from half lidded to wide in a second his hands squeezed tightly around the navy blue blanket that enveloped him\\n\\nakaashi\\n\\ni know he walked ahead quickly straight into the room he pushed the chair away and found bokutos side in bed\\n\\nfrail shaking fingers pushed through his own black and white hair in an attempt to calm himself down but another thunder clap sounded louder that time bokuto flinched hard enough to make the bed shake\\n\\nffuck his voice broke in terror\\n\\nlook at me its going to be fine akaashi spoke in a calm slow voice his hand took bokutos own and he held it gently it was cold and shook in short bursts you will get through this you always do\\n\\nstaring down wideeyed at the floor of the hospital room bokuto fought to find words\\n\\nakaash ddont bokuto struggled with his breathing\\n\\ndont what\\n\\ndont lleleave mme\\n\\ni wont leave you he moved closer his other hand taking hold of bokutos just breathe with me\\n\\nbokuto nodded frantically and forced himself to comply with akaashi as he always did he was the only person who could get him through those horrible moments after all\\n\\nheavy raindrops pelted against the window as bokutos frantic sounds filled the room akaashi was glad to have made it in time that had been one of bokutos worst attacks yet\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nhey akaashi\\n\\nhm\\n\\nwhen do you think it will snow\\n\\ni dont know snow falls at random\\n\\nyeah but do you think it will snow soon or maybe january\\n\\ni hope so that would be nice tokyo needs a little more snow now and then\\n\\nyeah yeah when it falls i want to go out and stand in it\\n\\nakaashi sat cross legged in the seat adjacent to bokutos bed he looked up at the sickly one when hed said those words trying to meet his gaze but ultimately finding no yellow eyes to look into bokuto had his head turned away\\n\\nhe was staring outside at the white clouds that shrouded the skies mesmerized by just how colorless it made everything seem it was one of those white days as bokuto liked to call them so he paid much more attention to the world beyond the glass than he did to his own confined life in the hospital bokuto breathed in deeply the sound filling the small space around them the bedsheets crumpled beneath his hands\\n\\nare you sure you should be going out in the cold like that\\n\\ni think i can handle it\\n\\nakaashi didnt want to bring up the fact that bokuto probably would no longer possess the ability to walk by the time any snow did get a chance to fall so he kept his mouth shut he rubbed his hands together weakly and tilted his head to the side\\n\\ni guess you can just as long as youre feeling better\\n\\nbokuto scoffed it was a quiet sound\\n\\ni am stop asking already that was six days ago\\n\\ni know but it was bad\\n\\nit passed bokuto turned his head the pillow crumpling under his neck he looked at akaashi with heavy lidded eyes he was extremely pale and somehow thinner than before but he kept that same smile on his face im fine now\\n\\nakaashi couldnt help but smile back at him he leaned his chin against the palm of his hand and chortled\\n\\nor at least as fine as you can get\\n\\nbokuto stared at akaashi sharply his lips quivered before he could form his words\\n\\nshut up a stronger laugh broke out from him rattling his body as he lay down in bed i look like shit i know\\n\\nakaashi found himself laughing along with him his quiet chuckle was louder than bokutos wholehearted laugh\\n\\nyou dont you dont look like shit he tried to hide his grin with his hand but it was still visible from the gaps between his fingers\\n\\nbokuto reached a hand out aimlessly trying to swat akaashis own hand away he tried to aim for it at the very least but found it difficult to still he continued\\n\\ndont cover that\\n\\ncover what\\n\\nyour smile\\n\\nwhy it isnt anything spe\\n\\ni barely ever see it bokutos fingers touched at akaashis knuckles that was enough for akaashi to remove his hand from in front his mouth slowly moving it to rest it over his chin he smiled down at him\\n\\nbokutos eyes stared forward with an engrossed gaze his yellow hues taking a mental picture of what he probably would never see again many words dashed through his mind but he could only think of three that would be best for him to say to akaashi he tried to open his mouth to say them but he performed another action instead unconsciously his hand grasped akaashis own and he dragged it down with his lack of strength causing both of them to startle bokutos eyes widened\\n\\ni i thought you would hold it up\\n\\nit was sudden akaashi stifled a laugh it caught me off guard\\n\\ni didnt mean to\\n\\nits alright he smoothed his thumb over bokutos knuckles im holding it now\\n\\nsilently and almost in fascination bokuto stared at akaashi once again longer this time before he looked up then down then away he turned his head towards the window away from akaashi he couldnt face him\\n\\npursing his lips timidly akaashi ceased to speak he studied the back of bokutos head eying the messy strands of black and white hair that overlapped each other his green eyes then fell to study his paling skin his veins were easily noticeable now and they bulged from beneath his flesh whenever he moved akaashis eyes lowered focusing on the arm that was attached to the hand that he was holding\\n\\nhe studied the small needle that was lodged into bokutos forearm eyed the thin tube that was attached to this and followed it up to the bag of iv fluid that hung above his head\\n\\nwhatever was left of akaashis smile faded\\n\\never since bokutos last panic attack it had suddenly become more difficult for him to control his words movements and actions altogether such a task as easy as swallowing was now a problem for bokuto too and after many failed attempts at keeping his food down or getting it to go down in the first place the nurses found it would be best if bokuto received nourishment the only other way possible and that was through a tube\\n\\nover the span of the six days akaashi found that the only things bokuto could manage to swallow were small snacks like grapes ice cubes and pocky sticks that were specifically strawberry flavored other than those things bokuto found it nearly impossible to stomach anything else his only other choice was to lie there and accept whatever it was the iv liquid had to offer him\\n\\nlooking back to bokuto he was relieved to see that he still had his attention on the window at some time while akaashi was spacing out the blue blanket that surrounded bokuto had been pulled up just below his chin with only his arm hanging out to hold onto akaashis hand bokutos breathing was quiet and his hand never really remained still for a long time it would shake every so often and each time it did akaashi would squeeze lightly in response this was their unspoken communication\\n\\nit was akaashis way of letting bokuto know that everything would be alright and this would always comfort him no matter the situation they were in\\n\\nthey both found it easier to believe in that lie than to accept the truth of what was to come\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\non the numbingly cold day that was january 3rd at 804 pm snow had fallen for the first time that year bokuto was the first to notice this but had also been the last to say anything about it\\n\\nit wasnt until akaashi looked up from his laptop screen that he realized it was snowing heavily outside his eyes lit up intent on informing bokuto but when he turned his head to get a look at him instead of being greeted by an over enthusiastic friend he was presented with an unfazed expression upon bokutos weary face\\n\\nakaashi frowned\\n\\nbokuto dont you see it\\n\\nlooking up from the laptop screen bokuto directed his attention to akaashi\\n\\nwh\\n\\nthe snow its snowing outside\\n\\nbokuto turned his head to catch another look out the window surely enough snow was falling and in chunks too but this did not grasp bokutos attention frankly speaking it had no affect on him in the slightest he managed a feeble shrug and turned to continue on with the movie that hed watched for the thirtieth time already\\n\\nakaashi was genuinely confused\\n\\ni thought you were waiting for the snow i thought it was what you wanted\\n\\nhis eyelids drooping and then snapping open again bokuto made a small sound\\n\\nmnh i see it all the time\\n\\njust then akaashis lips parted in realization bokutos hallucinations had become such a part of him that he thought the snow outside was just another mind trick he breathed in sharply\\n\\nits not a hallucination bokuto its actually snowing\\n\\n bokuto looked up to stare out the window again there was a longing in his eyes that akaashi couldnt stand to see with barely an ounce of strength left bokuto pulled himself up a tad to get a better look outside curiosity had sparked within him he wanted to know if it was real or not he hated how difficult it had become for him to tell apart the real things from the fake ones\\n\\nill show you akaashi stood from his seat and walked to the windowsill there he parted the glass slightly a gust of icy wind charged its way into the room in an instant draining the warmth from everything it touched\\n\\nbokutos skin crawled goose bumps pimpling his porcelain surface he pulled the thick blanket over himself with much effort\\n\\nswiftly akaashi closed the window having gathered just enough snow off the edge for him to show to bokuto he strode to him quickly cupping the already melting snow in his hands bokuto held out his own eager to see if it were true\\n\\nsee look akaashi placed the small white compressed lump of snow into bokutos palm this earned a gasp from him bokuto stared down at the white clump of melting ice and with one finger he pressed against it to watch it fall apart the tiny snowflakes deteriorated in the warmth of his palm leaving a small puddle behind\\n\\na gasp escaped bokuto his eyes widened as much as they could\\n\\nakaashi\\n\\ni know\\n\\ntake me outside\\n\\nits freezing akaashi murmured the words and looked bokuto up and down he was nothing more than a blanket with a head you tremble when its seventy degrees in the room right now its about ten degrees outside\\n\\nplease akaashi\\n\\npressing his lips into a thin slab of a line akaashi shook his head once more he found it much too difficult to say no to bokuto but it had to be done\\n\\ni cant\\n\\nbut why bokutos spirits fell his frown deep\\n\\nthat weather will only hurt you you need to be protected\\n\\nffrom what bokuto stared at akaashi his features having gone from disappointed to unaccepting\\n\\nakaashi drew in a breath but found that he couldnt say anything he watched bokuto with a wary gaze unaware of what he was to say next\\n\\nim already in death row i can barely speak i can barely walk i cant eat i cant sleep the llast thing you he clenched his jaw frustrated with himself and the words he spoke  you need to do is worry about me catching a cold\\n\\nbokuto\\n\\nc cold or nnot im still not going to last v very long so please let me have this\\n\\nhis eyes were glued to akaashis and akaashi found that he was unable to look away bokutos eyes said everything to him he translated all that his words could not\\n\\nakaashi looked down and away from bokuto then back to the window\\n\\n i think the window will be as far as we can go he said in a hushed voice\\n\\nthats fine with me and just like that a smile found bokutos face again\\n\\nakaashi sighed to himself frustrated with how easily hed given in to bokutos begging but as he thought of it he figured he couldnt be blamed for it he didnt want to be the one to say no to someone who had little to nothing left in his life\\n\\nthere was that and the fact that akaashi couldnt help but find bokutos smile endearing no matter how sickly he looked when he wore one\\n\\ncome on akaashi reached a hand out to help bokuto to his feet he urged him to keep the blanket around him but bokuto insisted that he leave it behind he held onto the iv stand with one hand and akaashis hand with his other as he hobbled over to the window bokutos hands were as cold as ice causing akaashis concern in him to grow even more but no matter how much he worried for him akaashi continued on their way to the window at a slow and steady pace until they finally made it\\n\\nonce there bokuto pulled his hand from akaashis and leaned it against the windowsill the air was bitter and cold and it hit bokuto like a slap to the face as another gust of wind forced its way into the hospital room this did not faze him however as bokuto only closed his eyes and inhaled deeply allowing the burn of the winter air to fill his lungs when he exhaled a puff of smoke left him bokuto stuck his head out of the window slightly and kept it there as the snowflakes fell all around him\\n\\ndont do that akaashi pulled bokuto back inside he expected to hear a whine of resistance from him but instead received nothing bokuto only complied and stuck his entire arm out instead watching as each individual snowflake passed around his limb as if none wanted to touch him on occasion one or two would land on him and he would draw his hand in quickly to try and see if he could make out the small pattern on them he would study them for quite a while until they melted and left behind nothing more than a droplet on his arm after this he would repeat the same process paying little to no mind to the freezing cold that surrounded him\\n\\nakaashi watched bokuto mesmerized by his actions he almost portrayed the behaviors of a child sticking to an activity and refusing to let it up repeating whatever he was up to without having anyone to tell him to stop akaashi furrowed his brow and looked outside away from bokuto that familiar feeling of dread was rising from deep within him something akaashi wanted to forget he placed one hand on the windowsill and squeezed his knuckles going white\\n\\nthey shared another moment of silence something that occurred more often than akaashi would have liked though bokutos speaking skills werent as good as they used to be he was still the more talkative one out of the two so whenever he went silent an unwelcomed feeling of discomfort found its home within akaashi he wanted to rid himself of this feeling rid himself of this silence so he searched his mind in haste for any word that came to mind he needed something  anything  to say to bokuto just so that he could liberate himself of the horrid feeling that threatened to overtake him\\n\\nyou know i never asked akaashi managed to say staring out into the distance why are you so fond of the snow bokuto\\n\\nhe waited for an answer but did not receive one unnerved he spoke up again\\n\\ni mean in your state now its a bit cliched dont you think it was his attempt at brightening the mood or being funny as some called it but alas his words had fallen flat on the ground as he received another silent reply from bokuto akaashi frowned deeply he turned his head to get a clear look at bokutos face but instantly wished he hadnt\\n\\nin his silence bokuto wept to himself fat tears rolling down his cheeks in numbers the hand that supported his weight against the windowsill trembled without pause and his other remained outside shaking in the cold dead of night several flakes had gathered on the outstretched limb but they were not quick to melt they settled there deeming bokuto one of them for the remainder of their frozen lives before they eventually melted or fell away\\n\\nakaashi stared at bokuto opened his mouth to say something but found that he couldnt form even one simple word realizing this akaashi decided to take action instead and reach out to comfort him but not even this he could do his arms and legs were stiff as were his eyes all he could do was stare at the melancholic performance that played out before him\\n\\ndo something akaashi closed his mouth and swallowed\\n\\n\\ndo something \\n\\nanything\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nakaashis body didnt respond\\n\\nhe could only watch as those tears fell at a faster pace down onto his hospital gown and onto the floor the light that came from outside reflected off of bokutos teardrops lighting his face up in the most gentle of ways eventually bokuto drew back his hand and let it fall to his side he hung his head and tried to keep his crying controlled in the best way possible but this proved to be very difficult as sobs broke out of him causing his entire being to shake\\n\\nafter a moment of trying to gather himself bokuto choked out two simple words with quivering lips\\n\\nwhy me\\n\\nakaashi stared on as his mind searched for words he found some and said them without a second thought\\n\\nbecause life is unfair\\n\\nbokuto reached up a cold frail hand to wipe at the mess that was his face i wanted to do sso many things\\n\\ni know akaashi balled his hand into a fist mentally scolding himself for the present lack of emotion in his voice\\n\\nas bokuto backed away from the window akaashi was quick to close it locking the bitter night air out of the room for the remainder of the night he then reached out and took hold of bokutos arm to help him back to the bed\\n\\nonce theyd reached it bokuto resumed his usual position and wrapped the thick blanket around himself then turned away from akaashi he watched the window quietly paying no mind to his visitor or so akaashi thought in a matter of minutes just as akaashi had started to fidget bokuto spoke up\\n\\nakaashi\\n\\nyes his undivided attention was on bokuto\\n\\nhe hesitated for a moment but finally spoke up i dont want you to visit me anymore\\n\\nakaashis eyes squinted to the words and he leaned forward in shock what\\n\\nplease dont visit me anymore\\n\\nno akaashi stood from his seat\\n\\nplease\\n\\nno its a little too late for that bokuto a shiver racked akaashi causing the hairs on the back of his neck to stand\\n\\nakaashi please\\n\\nno is my final answer he stalked over to the other side of the bed where he would be able to look at bokutos face once bokuto noticed this he turned his head and slowly rolled away akaashis eyes widened his emotions now falling victim to a strange mix of fear and fury\\n\\nbokuto what is the meaning of this\\n\\nbokuto didnt respond he remained in the same position and only moved his hand to wipe at his face again\\n\\nanswer me\\n\\nsucking his teeth bokuto pulled the blanket up to just beneath his chin it took some time but he finally answered\\n\\ni dont want you to grow any mmore attached to me ththan yyou already are\\n\\nakaashi nearly scoffed what makes you think im attached to you i never said that i was\\n\\nthis time bokuto directed his attention to akaashi he wore a grimace upon his reddened face\\n\\nshshut up akaashi he breathed in deeply frustrated with himself and the gradual growth of his speech impediment but continued on i know you hate hospitals dont come telling mme now that you have only been coming here every day because yyou wanted to\\n\\nakaashi had nothing else to say he stared at bokuto with his lips parted as if he were going to speak but ended up speechless\\n\\ni know that you care ev even if its just a little bit bokuto covered his mouth and coughed suddenly he found that speaking was taking much more energy than he thought still he continued to talk i dont know much about this disease partly because i was too afraid to read up on it but i know i dont have much time left his frustration slowly faded and all that was left behind upon his pale face was a look of defeat\\n\\none maybe two months at most if im lucky thats how long i know i have left\\n\\nthe air around akaashi thickened and suddenly he found it difficult to breathe\\n\\nbokuto looked down and twisted his lips to the side i heard the doctors talking they dont know how to hheal me so from beneath the blanket akaashi could see bokutos shoulders rise and fall its just a slow downhill ride ffrom here and i ddont want you to see it all hhappen\\n\\nbokuto lay there glasseyed his welled up tears glinting in the dim lighting of the room\\n\\ni dont want you to watch me decay\\n\\nsmall tears spilled out of bokutos eyes and rolled down his hauntingly placid features so i figured if you left now you wouldnt have to and it wouldnt hhurt so much\\n\\nonce again that crippling spell took hold of him and akaashi couldnt move nor could he speak all he could do was watch in muted anguish as bokuto finally accepted what had become of his short lived life akaashi realized that those smiles hed seen before were smiles of denial  forced grins that tried desperately to trick bokuto into thinking that everything would be fine but he couldnt keep it up forever not in the state that he was in bokuto had always been struggling to keep a positive front but inside he was falling apart all along\\n\\nakaashi knew this now\\n\\nin an attempt to move he tapped his fingers against his legs at an impatient pace he was trying everything he could to psych himself into doing at least something to let bokuto know that he was there for him\\n\\ndo something as if he were one of the living dead akaashi forced one leg forward then the next until he was touching the bed side he pushed his negative thoughts aside and sat himself down in bed right next to bokuto akaashi did not give him time to react to this as he moved closer still and when he was close enough he lowered his head to lean it on bokutos shoulder\\n\\nakaashi squeezed his hands together to keep them from shaking uncontrollably\\n\\nim not leaving koutarou his voice was hushed gentle and nothing you say will make me leave\\n\\nbokuto kept silent not a word left him even as he reached a hand up to wipe at his face again he only sniffed on occasion and shifted in place but never did he say anything to oppose akaashis decision\\n\\nhe was glad\\n\\nakaashi turned his head slightly his cheek gently resting on bokutos shoulder he took in a slow deep breath and closed his eyes and his eyebrows knit together for only a second his hands quivered as he dug his nails into his knuckles\\n\\nbokuto no longer smelled like a hospital\\n\\nbokuto smelled like home\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nthe reflection of ending movie credits could be seen in akaashis eyes as they scrolled up along the screen of his laptop\\n\\nsitting back he reached a hand out and paused the movie thatd been on screen\\n\\nso how was it watching the movie for the thousandth time there was almost a hint of sarcasm in his voice\\n\\nlying next to akaashi a ghostly pale bokuto smiled\\n\\ngood bokuto eased back and buried his head into his pillow he looked in akaashis direction it took a moment for bokuto to focus on him\\n\\npulling his laptop close akaashi smoothed his finger along the mouse pad he looked to the lower right corner of the screen january 19th 640pm\\n\\nakaashi pulled a solemn face and closed the laptop he moved in his seat and sat straight against the head of the bed then looked down at bokuto\\n\\nhis tired eyes were on akaashi he was grinning\\n\\nforcing a smile of his own akaashi tilted his head only slightly\\n\\nwhat are you smiling at he reached a hand out and touched bokutos forehead he was cool to the touch  colder than most akaashi was quick to withdraw his hand but he managed it discretely\\n\\nit took a moment for bokuto to respond but after some time he managed some words\\n\\n thank you\\n\\ndont worry about it a sheepish grin curled akaashis lips i know youre fond of that movie he looked down at bokuto as he said this and glanced away soon after something told him that those words werent meant for the movie but akaashi shoved this thought away\\n\\nhe twisted his body to reach for the box of pocky that sat on the counter he opened it and pulled one out\\n\\ndo you want one\\n\\nbokuto nodded and stretched a wobbling arm out akaashi placed it in between his fingers and bokuto retracted his hand to hold the biscuit snack against himself he held it to his nose with some difficulty and breathed in the strawberry scent then let his arm fall he touched at it lightly twirled it shakily between his fingers and studied it but he never ate it\\n\\nakaashi placed the box back onto the counter and huffed softly\\n\\nyou seem to have grown more attached to that pocky stick than me\\n\\nbokuto looked up surprised and glanced back down at the snack in his hands it took time for akaashis words to reach him but when they finally did his face lit up as he broke out in laughter\\n\\nit was the weakest sound akaashi had ever heard\\n\\nah ive finally said something funny akaashi chuckled with bokuto folding his arms in the process i told you i had my moments every so often\\n\\nbokutos laughter died down and he closed his eyes\\n\\nrarely\\n\\ngive me a break here akaashis chortling had been dragged out for a few seconds longer before he too quieted down\\n\\nthey remained speechless in each others company for several minutes before bokuto actually spoke up his voice sounding like nothing more than a mere whisper\\n\\nkeiji\\n\\nakaashi looked at him\\n\\nmhm\\n\\nbokuto swallowed thickly and toyed with the pocky in his hand\\n\\nask mme w why i like cloud atlas so much\\n\\nperplexed akaashi directed his full attention to bokuto\\n\\nwell alright koutarou why do you like cloud atlas so much he watched bokuto intently curious to know what his answer would be\\n\\nlooking up at akaashi with eager eyes as if hed been asked the question out of his own free will bokuto gladly answered\\n\\ns so you know in the mmovie when th characters die in one life he kept his weary yellow eyes on akaashi waiting for him to nod once he did bokuto continued wwell i like it when ththey find each other again in another life\\n\\nbokutos voice was soft measly and carried no force to it but as he spoke about his favorite scene akaashi could sense a powerful vibe coming from him one that wasnt there before\\n\\na hopeful one\\n\\nit mmakes me feel like ill hhave another life one beyond this one one thats better wh where i can actually wake up to you and be with y you a smile played on his pale thin lips one where we can live nnormal lives instead of living this one\\n\\nakaashi couldnt find any words to say at that moment he stared at bokuto and could only nod with whatever it was he thought he was agreeing with he felt as if all the air had been squeezed out of his body by the words that bokuto had spoken\\n\\nof all the things that bokuto found most endearing of the movie akaashi never thought it would be that\\n\\nmanaging a miserable smile akaashi roughly rubbed his palm with his thumb\\n\\nyou know i would like that very much he spoke gently in bokutos direction\\n\\nme too bokutos eyes never left akaashi he stared at him intently and watched every move he made to the point where this had captured akaashis attention\\n\\nwhy do you watch me like that his emerald eyes met golden ones\\n\\nthough the question was asked clearly bokuto didnt make a sound nor did he move he instead continued to stare in akaashis direction with hopeful eyes\\n\\nafter what felt like the longest ten seconds of his life a sudden shudder charged down akaashis spine causing goose bumps to rise on his flesh he held his breath then proceeded to ask again\\n\\nkoutarou why do you watch me like that it took every fiber of his being to keep his voice from trembling\\n\\nit was then that bokutos eyes blinked in realization and slowly but surely he moved his lips to answer\\n\\njust because he replied in what almost sounded like a surprised tone i didnt want you to leave sometimes when i blink you arent there anymore bokuto rubbed one of his eyes then the other and let his hand drop to his sides\\n\\nakaashi tried to hide his frown his eyes looked down at bokutos hands they were thin and bony and he could see those smooth blue veins curling over the bones beneath his flesh\\n\\nhe reached a hand out and took bokutos hand in his own\\n\\nbokutos automatic reaction to the warmth was to curl his fingers around akaashis grasp he looked at him and exhaled through his nose quietly\\n\\nakaashi met his gaze then looked down\\n\\ndont worry im still here\\n\\nbokuto nodded feebly against his pillow\\n\\nim still here too his voice was weaker than before if possible\\n\\nakaashi nodded with him\\n\\nyeah youre still here too\\n\\nwith what little strength he had left bokuto beamed\\n\\nakaashi wished he could do the same\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nnew message\\n\\nfrom kuroo sent january 31st at 225 pm\\n\\nhey are you there\\n\\nakaashi\\n\\nyes i am\\n\\nkuroo\\n\\nhow are things\\n\\nakaashi\\n\\nthings could be better things could be worse\\n\\nkuroo\\n\\nmay i ask how bokuto is doing\\n\\nakaashi\\n\\nhes hanging on\\n\\nkuroo\\n\\ncan he still walk or talk\\n\\nakaashi\\n\\nno he cant he lost the ability to walk a little more than a week ago his ability to speak left him soon after\\n\\nkuroo\\n\\ni see you really are straightforward arent you\\n\\nakaashi\\n\\ni dont know any other way to put it sorry\\n\\nakaashi looked up from his phone after sending the message and turned his head to notice that bokuto was once again staring at him with acute interest\\n\\nhis eyes read whos that\\n\\nstuffing his phone in his pocket akaashi shrugged\\n\\njust kuroo he said the name with a lack of interest to try and soften the blow but akaashi knew that no matter how he approached it bokuto would frown when he heard the name\\n\\nand he did\\n\\nbokuto looked down at akaashis hand his eyes gave away just how much he missed his friend feeling an amount of guilt build up within his chest akaashi pulled out his phone just as quickly as hed hid it away\\n\\nwould you like for him to send a photo\\n\\nbokuto looked back up and thought for a moment then nodded\\n\\nplaying off of this akaashi texted for kuroo to send an image of himself for bokuto to see it took quite some time for a message from kuroo to arrive but when it did akaashi realized that hed sent a video instead of what was initially asked for\\n\\nakaashi leaned over in his seat to move himself closer to bokuto with one elbow on the bed he held his phone so that the both of them could see bokuto stared at the screen with interested eyes wondering what the content would consist of akaashi pressed play and a video of kuroo started to play\\n\\nhe sat at home in bed with a snug fitting shirt on and his hair an absolute mess\\n\\nwhats up guys ahhhh i know you didnt tell me to send a video but im not someone who follows rules he pulled a mock cool expression but this was cut short as someone else spoke up\\n\\nfrom the background of the video a low voice could be heard\\n\\nwhat did you just say that to yourself\\n\\nno wow no im taking a video\\n\\nkuroo panned the phone to his side and a blurred kenma came into focus on screen he sat crosslegged with a shirt on that was two sizes too big and a hat that looked as if it had been placed on his head without his consent his head was down and his fingers moved swiftly over the buttons on the gaming device that he held in his hands at one point he reached a hand up to grab the beanie off of his head and he aimlessly chucked it to the ground with force\\n\\nsay hi kenma\\n\\nwait what i didnt hear what you said kenma looked up and was greeted with a front facing camera he quickly got up from the bed and walked off dont record me\\n\\nat least say hi kuroo called\\n\\nhi the disembodied voice came from off screen\\n\\nand thats kenma for you kuroo groaned as he repositioned himself in bed and then he smiled but putting him aside i hope all is well um he scratched at his cheek just below his eye i miss you guys i miss you especially bokuto um hang in there alright akaashi dont give him a hard time or you and i are going to fucking fight\\n\\nbokuto smiled wide to those words he would have laughed if he could\\n\\na grin ghosted across akaashis lips as well but it was quick to vanish\\n\\nwell i guess thats it for now i would have kenma say bye too but he turned his head to look around he left the room yeah he left the room so ill just say bye for him see you bokuto keep it cool and remember youre the best he held his hand up in a peace sign and the video ended with him on screen\\n\\nakaashi sighed he thought the video had gone by too quickly but it had actually lasted a little under thirty seconds\\n\\nfor a guy whos name is kuroo he sure is a colorful one akaashi sat up and placed his phone on the counter\\n\\nbokuto nodded and looked up at akaashi once again\\n\\nyou guys were best friends huh\\n\\nbokuto nodded once more he struggled to raise a hand and slowly he twirled his index finger in circles at the side of his head\\n\\nakaashi snorted softly and leaned back in his seat\\n\\nis he crazy\\n\\nthe smile on bokutos lips grew just a little more signifying that hed answered yes to akaashis question\\n\\nit was moments like these that made akaashi realize just how much of an innocent soul bokuto really was every now and then it would come to him that bokuto was only twenty years old and that fact would only weigh akaashi down even more than it usually did it hurt him to think that bokuto had barely even experienced the joys of a young adults life before that crippling disease had taken a hold of him it was frustrating it was infuriating and it was overall saddening but akaashi could not show any of this not in front of bokuto\\n\\nso instead of putting on a sour expression akaashi only kept a neutral one like he always did it was his best and only way to hide his pain\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nseveral hours had passed since the message from kuroo and both bokuto and akaashi didnt do much\\n\\nwithout a voice bokuto couldnt keep up a conversation as well as he used to no matter how hard he tried and even if he could speak he wouldnt have been able to talk for long considering the state he was in his movements were uncoordinated and slow and the only sounds he could manage were meek and most of the time inaudible at times bokuto would do nothing but lie there in bed twitching back awake whenever his body tried so desperately to fall into the sleeping state that it once knew when this would happen hed pull a frustrated expression for only a moment before his face grew too tired to hold it any longer\\n\\nwhen bokuto was like this akaashi would normally look away to spare himself the sight of it all but on rare occasions there were times when hed have no choice but to watch bokuto fall apart at the hands of his illness and he hated it\\n\\nfor every time akaashi would witness this his mind would repeat one phrase whether he wanted to hear it or not\\n\\n\\nthis is what a dying person looks like\\n\\n\\nlooking down swiftly akaashis sights locked onto his hands he glared at them intensely with that same placid expression of his making this look all the more unnerving he wanted the thought to leave his mind he wanted nothing to do with it he forced those words away and replaced them with new ones ones that said hes not dying hes going to be fine\\n\\nbut as he thought of it as he narrowed down the true meanings of both phrases he ultimately could not decide which of the two were more horrifying\\n\\nakaashi closed his eyes and heaved out a sigh feeling more and more hopeless with each passing second he feared he wouldnt be able to pull himself out of this state but then it occurred to him that he was not alone in this\\n\\nhe felt the gentlest of taps against his arm and he turned his head to meet eyes that were as concerned as they were exhausted akaashi sat up straight and composed himself\\n\\nim fine he commented softly leaning back in his seat how are you feeling koutarou\\n\\nbokuto blinked slowly this was his way of saying he was feeling alright not great but alright\\n\\nakaashi pursed his lips and nodded once he found himself unable to say anything else figuring that bokuto wouldnt have anything to say either but he was wrong\\n\\nagain he felt the light tapping against his arm surprised akaashi gave bokuto his attention again\\n\\nhm what is it he turned the chair so that he was now facing bokuto from the front\\n\\ngazing up at akaashi bokuto frowned and tried to form some words but failed in the end he looked around and moved his fingers trying to make out a phone akaashi picked this up quickly and he pulled his phone out for bokuto to use he opened his notes application and held the device in front of bokuto it was then that he started to inaccurately press at words that he was trying to make out it took him some time to get down what he wanted to say but after several minutes he withdrew his hand\\n\\nakaashi looked at his phone to read the sentence it read\\n\\nif i knew those words i spoke a week ago would have been my last i would have chosen them more carefully\\n\\nakaashi stared intensely at the screen then tore his gaze away and looked back to bokuto\\n\\nyou werent happy with those words\\n\\nslowly bokuto nodded\\n\\nwell then if you had a second chance akaashi hesitated he almost didnt want to ask the question what would you have chosen to say\\n\\njust as those words left akaashis mouth the clouds outside parted allowing the setting suns orange light to flood into the room it illuminated both bokuto and akaashi and they squinted at the same time despite this akaashi did not miss the look of slight nervousness that claimed bokutos features\\n\\nhe was now more curious than hed ever been before\\n\\num bokuto you dont have to say it now if you dont want to\\n\\nbokuto shook his head\\n\\nso you dont want to\\n\\nhe shook his head again stronger this time\\n\\nah you do want to say it now\\n\\nthis time a weak sound left bokutos throat through a closed mouth and he nodded\\n\\nalright akaashi shifted in his seat now timid he glanced to the side how many words are there in what you want to say i mean\\n\\nresponding as slowly as ever bokuto raised one hand on that one hand three fingers stuck out\\n\\nakaashi felt his heart sink to his stomach another shudder threatened to rattle him but he kept himself still as difficult as that was\\n\\nthree words thats all akaashi forced a smile they felt mandatory now thats interesting\\n\\n\\nplease please dont say them \\n\\n\\nhe reached his arm out and held his phone in front of bokuto for him to type\\n\\n\\nplease dont type them i dont want to hear them i dont want to read them i dont want to know them\\n\\n\\nfor what felt like an eternity bokuto typed the words on akaashis phone his hand wobbled so much that it was impossible to decipher which letters he was hitting akaashi was close to holding his breath before bokuto had finally drew his hand back he let it fall over his stomach and there it rested his golden eyes searched the room for akaashi when hed finally found him those shining eyes of his lit up just a little more than usual and with that glint came his smile it was small and measly but there\\n\\nakaashi made sure to take a mental picture of this before he looked down and closed his eyes he gripped his phone in his hand and took in a deep breath filling his lungs with all the air that he could before he exhaled through his nostrils he turned his phone so that it was facing him opened his eyes and read the three words that would haunt him forever\\n\\n or so he thought\\n\\nakaashis eyes widened slightly and his eyebrows knit together in surprise what sat upon the screen was not what he thought it would be but rather a simple compliment\\n\\nyou are beautiful\\n\\nfreezing in his seat akaashi read the words ten times over before he finally looked up he could feel his heartbeat thumping hard against his chest as if it wanted to break free his eyes locked onto bokutos\\n\\nyou think that im beautiful he asked this in a tone of disbelief\\n\\nmustering a weak nod bokutos lips curled at the sides just a bit more with this he raised a quivering hand and his index finger he was trying to tell akaashi something else\\n\\nguessing quickly akaashi muttered one\\n\\nbokuto kept his finger up then moved his hand to point it at himself he did not give akaashi time to voice his guess as he then moved his finger to point at his eye then finally at akaashi\\n\\nweakly akaashi parted his lips he almost couldnt find his voice but when he did he tried his best to keep it from shaking\\n\\nsince the first day you saw me\\n\\nto this bokutos arm fell and rested lightly on his stomach he did the only thing that he could and nodded again then closed his eyes and slightly turned his head away\\n\\nakaashi watched curiously as bokutos lips quivered into a wide grin and as the light captured his features akaashi realized just how embarrassed bokuto actually was\\n\\nhis face glowed the quietest shade of red and he tried to hide it from akaashi it seemed that after finally hearing his pent up thoughts aloud they had frayed his nerves more than he thought they would\\n\\nseeing this display unfold before him akaashi could barely think his heart beat a mile a minute he found it difficult to swallow and one of his legs bounced up and down rapidly he didnt know how to react didnt know what to do or say but as he searched for the right words to speak or the right thing to do akaashi found himself doing something he didnt expect of himself\\n\\na light hearted laugh bubbled out from deep within his chest and the sound filled the room as soon as it hit the air he laughed hard or at least as hard as he could his voice was gentle light on bokutos ears it caused him to open his eyes and look in akaashis direction astonished those honeyhued eyes took in all that they could of akaashis laughing face the way his lips curled at the corners the way his eyes squinted just enough so that only a glint of green could be seen bokuto captured it all and in no time he found himself laughing too\\n\\nit was a quiet laugh it was so weak and feeble it could barely be heard but it was there and akaashi could hear it so that was enough for bokuto his face still wore the same shade of red but he no longer minded this he was happy where he was he was happy that hed admitted those words he was glad that akaashi found company in him\\n\\nfinding a breath between his laughter akaashi managed to speak\\n\\nyoure ridiculous he said lightheartedly his fingers trembling around his phone\\n\\nbokuto gave him a look that could only be read as i am arent i\\n\\nslowly akaashis laugh eased into a chuckle and as he sat there in his seat he looked down at bokuto with placid eyes a genuine expression made its home on akaashis features and a hand reached up to push through his raven locks\\n\\nthank you koutarou he whispered softly his voice shaking in his throat he reached a hand out and found bokutos\\n\\nbokuto tightened his grasp in that automatic way he always did he stared up at akaashi with that smile that never seemed to fade his eyes read\\n\\nyoure welcome keiji\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nfebruary 2nd\\n\\n\\nwhat time is it\\n\\n\\nakaashi stirred in bed slightly and let out a weak grunt he didnt bother to check he didnt care\\n\\nthe sky was already black he figured it was already past five in the afternoon so he didnt care anymore he didnt care if it was seven at night or eight at night or twelve in the morning or if the worlds clock stopped moving altogether\\n\\nall he cared about was the fact that bokuto was still with him next to him breathing alive\\n\\nall he cared about was the fact that bokuto koutarou was still there\\n\\nakaashi moved his head to the side and touched his forehead to bokutos neck\\n\\nbokutos movements were late to this but he reacted nonetheless as he turned akaashis way to touch his chin to the top of his head the soft touch of akaashis hair against his chin comforted bokuto and pulled him into a relaxed state\\n\\nakaashi liked it when this happened it would cause less spasms to grip bokutos body allowing him to unwind more than he usually could akaashi didnt know why he had this effect on him but he did and that was all that mattered to him\\n\\nthe day was exceptionally cold but akaashi was glad to know that the hospitals room provided enough heat to keep bokuto from freezing over but even so bokuto still suffered from trembling spells and they would come in small short bursts and last only several seconds before his body became too weak to keep it up\\n\\nakaashi always made sure to hold bokuto close and squeeze him tight whenever this happened just to let him know that he was there for him that he wasnt another one of those illusions his mind would create akaashi would also murmur quiet things to him from time to time to keep up a small often one sided conversation hed usually ask yes or no questions ones that were easy for bokuto to answer with a nod or shake of the head but sometimes he wouldnt answer certain questions despite akaashi asking them twice\\n\\nhe wouldnt always get answers akaashi was aware of this but he would still ask him things at other times he would just tell him things that were on his mind\\n\\nit was strange how the less bokuto asked the more akaashi found himself saying\\n\\nrelaxing his head against the crook of bokutos neck akaashi blinked wearily and stared off into the distance he focused on nothing something he remembered kenma doing his hand held onto one of bokutos very thin arms and his thumb would occasionally rub up and down to comfort him they shared the same navy blue knit blanket and huddled up beneath it keeping each other warm in the best way that they could as akaashi lay there quiet listening to bokutos strained breathing he opened his mouth to speak\\n\\nkoutarou\\n\\nhe spoke just loudly enough for bokuto to hear him he felt him move against his head in response so he continued he drew in a deep breath and blinked away the stinging in his eyes\\n\\ni want you to know that i dont regret meeting you\\n\\nbokuto didnt move much he just breathed now\\n\\ni am very happy to have met you and to have gotten to know you\\n\\nakaashi paused for a long moment and said nothing for a while but then he spoke up again\\n\\nso thank you koutarou for talking to me me in the hall that day and asking me if i was alright because i wasnt then but i am now\\n\\nslipping his head down to bokutos chest akaashi leaned against his frail frame akaashi listened to the quickened rate of bokutos still beating heart and knew that this was his response to his words\\n\\nakaashi closed his eyes against him he found he had nothing more to say he instead allowed his actions to speak for him he pulled himself closer to bokuto and nudged his face into the warmth of his neck he could feel bokutos chin rubbing against the top of his head like it always did it never failed to comfort akaashi he breathed in that familiar scent that hed grown so attached to then exhaled quietly against bokutos prominent collar bone\\n\\nakaashi could feel a weak ailing arm pull itself up to rest upon his shoulder to this he shifted in closer and allowed his body to relax his breathing evened out and in no time he could feel himself slipping slowly into the warm grasp of sleep unable to resist\\n\\nin a daze akaashis last words were good night koutarou before he slipped off into a deep sleep\\n\\nhe dreamt of nothing in particular that night he suffered no nightmares nor did he see anything remotely close to a dream there was nothing there was only blackness\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nakaashi woke up to the feeling of sunlight against his face it was warm on him certainly something that one would find comforting but as he stirred in bed he was certain that something was off\\n\\nhe kept his eyes halflidded and his movements reserved clinging onto the false hope that bokuto wasnt moving because he didnt want to wake him but akaashi knew that this wasnt the case he just didnt want to accept it\\n\\nstretching out a trembling arm akaashi took hold of bokutos hand he shut his eyes and squeezed his palm it was cold his hand trembled harder with each passing second as if the movement would cause bokuto to wake up akaashis face buried into the crook of his neck he nudged the bridge of his nose against the cool skin his lips brushed against his collarbone in desperate search of that familiar warmth both hands had clasped around bokutos own now quavering without pause he couldnt find his pulse\\n\\ndevastation weighed down on akaashi in that instant it was a surreal feeling one that he could never in one million years describe it squeezed him threatening to crush him from the inside out the pain seared itself into his soul hindering him rendering him speechless to a point where he no longer knew what words were\\n\\na sob wretched its way out from akaashis throat\\n\\nhe tried desperately to hold it in tried so hard to keep himself together but he knew he was too weak to pull such a bluff once the second sob had left him he felt himself spiraling there was no hiding it he was undone\\n\\nhis body jerked with each sob that was torn from him his frame curling to bring himself closer he held his face against the corpses neck just beneath the jawline breathing in all that was left of bokuto\\n\\nhe had so many things hed wanted to do with him so many things hed wanted to say but all of those things seemed to have fallen away once the moment had finally come akaashi wanted to scream but he couldnt find his voice not even a sentence could get past his suffering\\n\\nhe kept himself against bokuto and held onto him with what little strength he had left in him he didnt get up to alert the nurses or the doctors or anyone in the hospital he knew that once they found out they would take bokuto away from him\\n\\nso he stayed in place holding onto bokuto taking in his company for one last time before hed never see him again\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nonce akaashi had left the hospital he never looked back\\n\\nhe walked home that day with a balled up blanket in his arms a burgundy scarf around his neck and nothing more from the hospital he held them against his frame in the twenty degree weather and though many people gave him strange looks and watched him sideways none of this affected him in the slightest the cold was no longer a factor to akaashi he couldnt feel it his mind wouldnt allow him to\\n\\nhe made it home without so much as a hello to his parents who sat in the living room they asked him questions he answered blatantly they asked about the blanket and the scarf but they never asked about bokuto\\n\\nakaashi was glad it was a good idea to have never told them about him after all\\n\\nhe ascended the steps to his room balled his  no  bokutos blanket up into a lump and dropped it onto his bed along with the scarf he reached into his pocket to fish out his phone and pushed call on one of his contacts he held it up to his ear and waited for the other line to pick up once it did akaashi was greeted with a hello\\n\\nakaashi hesitated he swallowed thickly and looked out the window\\n\\nhello kuroo its akaashi are you busy\\n\\nkuroos voice was reserved and reluctant\\n\\nno im not\\n\\nif it isnt too much trouble may i come over\\n\\nkuroo was quiet on the other end he already knew he inhaled audibly and akaashi could hear a scratching sound after a moment he finally spoke his voice was solemn\\n\\nsure\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nakaashi sat at the edge of kuroos bed and he stared out the window without focus kuroo spoke to him and akaashi listened and often responded but most of the time he only sat there and continued to watch nothing\\n\\nkuroo would have been concerned if not for finding out what had happened earlier that day he was much like akaashi sitting on the same side of the bed a good distance apart from his visitor those yellow eyes of his would often dart to the floor then to the ceiling around the room and back to the floor but he would never look at akaashi\\n\\nhe feared that if he did he wouldnt be able to keep his emotions at bay\\n\\nhow did he look kuroo asked with a hushed tone\\n\\nit took akaashi a while to respond\\n\\nwhen i woke up\\n\\nyeah kuroo looked down\\n\\nakaashi let out a halfassed grunt and continued to stare forward\\n\\npale sick dead\\n\\nhow did you find out that he wasnt there anymore\\n\\nhis entire body was relaxed his head rested on mine with the weight of someones whos unconscious\\n\\nthis time kuroo was the one to grunt the sound coming from deep within his chest he was slow to speak up again but did either way\\n\\nare you going to his funeral\\n\\nno\\n\\nthe answer came so much more quickly than kuroo thought it would it shocked him as akaashi continued\\n\\ni refuse to go my last memory of bokuto will not be of him sharply dressed pale stiff and stuffed in a casket surrounded by a countless amount of people who did not care for him at all until the day they heard about his death my last memory of koutaro is already with me and it will die along with me\\n\\nakaashis tone was monotonous but kuroo didnt fail to detect the venom that lined each word prior to his last sentence he understood where akaashi was coming from and didnt even think of holding his icy tone against him kuroo was just as bitter he too did not intend on showing up to any funeral hed be furious with everyone in there and he knew that the same pain burned within akaashi too\\n\\nkuroo leaned forward and joined his hands together he stared at the wall and bounced one leg up and down as his emotions slowly started to reclaim him\\n\\nyou know um he looked down and rubbed his neck roughly leaving behind deep red marks bokuto he he really liked uh cared about you he talked about you all the time when he first met y\\n\\ndont\\n\\nkuroo froze with his hand clinging to his neck he slowly looked up to find that akaashi was staring back at him with vacant eyes void of all known emotion\\n\\ndont kuroo just dont\\n\\nhe swallowed thick and turned his head to stare out the window again akaashi laced his fingers together and dug his nails into the backs of his hands he was redirecting the pain\\n\\nsorry it was the last word kuroo murmured before he stared forward as well having nothing more to say\\n\\nthey shared each others company in silence for what felt like the length of five minutes and in that time akaashi never once looked to the side to catch a glimpse at kuroo it wasnt until he watched kuroos form double over in his peripheral that akaashi did glance in his direction and when he did he was greeted with a quietly sobbing kuroo his face having been buried in the palms of his hands though is was delayed akaashi moved on instinct and sat near kuroo he placed a hand on his broad back and rubbed gently hoping to comfort him and to be the stronger of the two but as each second passed akaashi could feel his own pain building up more and more within him he wished he could fight it but he knew there was no possible way for him to\\n\\nit wasnt long before akaashi had leaned his head on kuroos shoulder as he too fell victim to the sorrow that slowly ate him alive\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nit had been three days since bokutos passing and surely enough sleep did not come to akaashi as easily as it used to in the span of those three days he had only acquired a little over four hours of sleep in total on the first night out of the three akaashi flat out refused to get any rest in fear of suffering another night terror but during the other two nights he surely did make the effort to try and lull himself to sleep but each time he did he either found himself stirring awake from a strange dream or lying wide awake in the middle of the night half expecting to receive a message from bokuto\\n\\nat times akaashi would look through the conversations that hed shared with him hed scroll up up up until the first text then would scroll all the way down again waiting for the ellipse to appear on the lower left side of the screen but always hed receive nothing\\n\\nthat night was no different as akaashi repeated this action for the twentieth time that day his thumb scrolling up and down for minutes on end until he finally came to a stop when he had however instead of shutting his phone off and trying to force a few hours of sleep upon himself akaashi stared at the phone screen longingly and read the last messages that were sent between them\\n\\nbokuto sent at 215 am december 20th\\n\\nhey akaashiiiii are you awake\\n\\nakaashi\\n\\nyes i am what is it\\n\\nbokuto\\n\\nim excited for you to come over tomorrow\\n\\nakaashi\\n\\ni visit you every day though\\n\\nbokuto\\n\\ni know you never miss a day dont your parents ever ask why you come here so much\\n\\nakaashi\\n\\nthey think im interning so they dont mind\\n\\nbokuto\\n\\noh works for me 9 o w\\n\\nakaashi\\n\\ni would hope so it works for me as well ill be sure to bring my laptop when i visit we can watch cloud atlas again\\n\\nbokuto\\n\\nyes please thank you akaashi\\n\\ndecember 20th at 345 am\\n\\nyou probably fell asleep sorry for always messaging you so late sleep well akaashi ill see you soon\\n\\nakaashi frowned and felt that familiar pain pierce his chest he reread sleep well akaashi and inhaled with frailty\\n\\nim trying\\n\\nhe couldnt bring himself to read over the last four words of the text again and ultimately shut off his phone he placed it on the counter near his bedside and buried himself into the blanket that he had so openly shared with bokuto akaashi inhaled deeply and closed his eyes his eyebrows knitting together as his brow creased it still smelled like him\\n\\nakaashi relaxed himself against his mattress and closed his eyes a powerless yawn leaving him his head eased into his pillow and to his surprise within a matter of minutes he could feel himself slipping it felt strange not falling asleep against bokutos body but akaashi knew that he would have to get used to this form of sleeping by his lonesome once again he just hoped that the night wouldnt bring him any malevolent dreams all he wanted was to see bokuto again even if just for a second an exhausted breath left him and akaashi finally fell asleep\\n\\nthat night he dreamt of the first night bokuto had come over his home he dreamt of how bokuto had buried himself into the navy blue blanket to watch the movie that played on the laptop screen and how he held bokuto in his arms that night to aid him in his attempt to sleep he could still remember the small details like how bokutos starry shirt would slip off his shoulder every so often when he stirred in bed and how the feel of bokutos weight on him would take his breath away akaashi could still feel the sensation of his wild white and black hair brushing against his cheek whenever he moved and the warmth that came from him as he held him close it was all still there but there was something different about it all that puzzled akaashi\\n\\nat one point in his dream akaashi looked out the window the night sky had suddenly become a pale blue and the warm orange glow of the sun slowly spread across the horizon he turned his head slowly to look at bokuto and watched him as he lay in his arms akaashi said his name and to this bokuto stirred awake he turned his head and met akaashis gaze with weary well rested eyes he stretched and stifled a yawn pushed a hand through the mess that was his hair and relaxed his head against akaashis shoulder\\n\\nsunlight broke into the room cascading all along the walls and floor and casting shadows all around it lit bokutos face up just enough for akaashi to take in those healthy features that were staring back at him he felt his heart rate accelerate and his throat tightened as his vision blurred bokuto beamed at him with a smile that spoke a thousand words and his hand reached out to touch akaashis cheek akaashi felt his palm warm full caressing the round of his face he leaned into his touch and his vision began to fade his eyes welling with tears\\n\\nbokuto leaned in and touched his forehead to akaashis he was only a blurred shape now but akaashi knew he was still there bokuto spoke his voice peaceful healthy whole\\n\\ni found you\\n\\na trembling tender laugh escaped akaashi he smiled\\n\\nyou found me'"

       "'      it had been some time since akaashi set foot into that hospital  it was a dreary place for him a place he was not fond of but a place he was obligated to visit akaashis parents were intent on having him intern in a hospital nearby so that he could stockpile more things that would look good on his resume for future purposes  often times however akaashi would disagree with his parents unhappy with the suggestions theyd given him but ultimately they would urge him to carry out the task that had been pushed on him and one way or another hed do it  asking around here and there the male put little to no effort in finding out where he could go to sign up for what he didnt care nor did he think he would care in the near future akaashi was unhappy with where he was unhappy with what it was that he was doing he was wasting time asking for something that he did not want in the least  pointing a finger down the hall a small assistant nurse directed akaashi to a different desk one where he would be able to find more information on the subject blatantly he thanked her and continued on his way passing by several rooms as he did so  his eyes where set forward he didnt look into any of the rooms he didnt want to it would hurt if he did  akaashi closed his eyes and sighed swaying absentmindedly in his step opening his eyes just in time to swiftly avoid colliding with someone   a doctor no just another person   he circled around the male apologizing flatly before he continued on an its alright could be heard from behind him but it soon faded as akaashi continued forward   do i really want to do this   his eyes stared forward uninterested in the information desk several meters from him   no i really dont   standing still akaashi remained in place for quite some time his legs refusing to carry him further people walked by him around him up and down the halls to and fro but no one seemed to notice him he stood there hesitant uninterested indifferent  unfeeling  he remained in place silently no one was bothered by him so there he stood he brought a hand up to push through his black hair and slowly his head fell forward akaashi stared at his shoes   what am i doing   the thought rattled his mind   why am i even here   another person walked by at a gradual pace at first then slowed progressively as they drew near their walking then slowed to a halt and it was then that akaashi had become aware of the new individual whod invaded his personal space  from his peripheral akaashi could see their hand reaching out to him  he withdrew and looked up  oh you can move he smiled in akaashis direction bright yellow eyes catching his own it had been the same guy hed almost bumped into perhaps hed remained in the hall and watched as akaashi had gone from a brisk walk to a sudden stop he understood how that would be alarming to some people  is there something wrong with me standing here akaashi asked sincerely  no i dont think so he brought his hand down to his side why did you stop so suddenly are you alright  im fine i was just thinking akaashi blinked slowly  of what   a question asker how thrilling    of this hospital ive realized that i dont want to come here anymore  the male who stood across from akaashi shifted his weight to one leg were you sick are you checking out  akaashi stared through the stranger no im not sick but this place makes me feel like i am his answer was cold but it did not seem to cut through the others pleasant mood  i feel the same about this place honestly he paused so you must be leaving soon then  yeah akaashi shifted leaning in the direction of where hed come from  he had no interest in staying where he was his only intention was leaving he figured he would tell his parents that the people in the hospital were too occupied with everything else to tend to him he started on his way without so much as a second glance in the others direction goodbye  hey hey  akaashi turned his head what  whats your name  why did he want to know his name when would he ever use it again the stranger could have been a patient at the hospital for all akaashi knew and the last thing he needed was a sickly acquaintance to add to his already short list of friends  you dont need to know  the male across from him did well in hiding the look of offense that almost surfaced upon his face i understand but for what its worth my name is bokuto  akaashi cast a weary look in bokutos direction gave a nod and continued on his way until he was out of the building        two weeks had passed since akaashis last visit and to his dismay he found himself on the same aimless path back to the same dreaded hospital he couldnt stand his parents persistent natures but he was somewhat relieved to be out of the house to say the least   here we go again   akaashi entered the building and greeted the woman at the front desk as always he wasted no time ascending the steps needed to get to the part of the hospital where hed almost reached all that time ago in minutes the information desk was in his sights and for the first time in forever hed actually gone to it  he spoke with a small woman there and after several minutes had passed akaashi backed away from the desk some sheets of paper in hand he started down the hall sighing heavily intent on rushing home  hey hey its you  the familiar voice made akaashis throat tighten another sigh was forced out even heavier this time he turned around  bokuto  apathykun he grinned from ear to ear  dont call me that akaashi stuffed the sheets into his bag  i thought you said you werent ever going to set foot in here again there was something strange about the excitement in his tone  i didnt say exactly that  but it was implied  akaashi squinted  yes it was implied  bokutos smile never left his face and his tired eyelids contradicted his facial expression   why must i always run into the strange ones    so what brings you here again  i could ask you the same thing akaashis lips screwed to the side  thick white eyebrows raised above yellow hues im supposed to be here actually  akaashi yawned intern  no patient his smile was unnerving  silently the dark haired male frowned ive been insensitive  a laugh bubbled out from bokuto no you havent dont worry about it  though hed been dressed in normal casual clothing upon further examination there was indeed something sickly about him he was paler than the others who walked along in the halls and soft dark circles sat under his eyes  akaashi made sure not to stare  i know you arent going to ask so ill just let you know from what ive heard the doctors say that whatever i have is called ffi bokuto folded his arms he held an air around him as if he were having a normal conversation about the weather fatal familial insomnia if i remember correctly  a cold shiver curled up akaashis spine hed never heard of that disease before it worried him enough to get some words out of him  i dont think i want to ask about the symptoms of this illness  well even if you wanted to i wouldnt have an answer for you another laugh all i can say is that sleeping doesnt come as easily as it used to what normally would have pained someone to say he delivered with ease and with that same grin to boot  akaashi couldnt help but almost smile back his lips barely twitching he stared in bokutos direction at him this time are you here every day  of course been here for about four weeks now he blinked sluggishly  i see akaashi nodded once no words were exchanged for a moment and soon the short amount of silence had become awkward well ill be going now   shut him out dont let him in hes sick    ahuh one second  akaashis jaw clenched i have to go bokuto he started on his way   please dont persist   if you would please listen his hands at his sides bokuto bowed please it will only take a second  akaashi was straightforward but he wasnt heartless he huffed out a breath and turned around what is it i really have to go  his eyes lighting up bokuto straightened his back and fished his hand into his pocket he pulled out a phone and to akaashis dread he asked for his phone number  what was he to do what was he to say akaashi literally found nothing special about bokuto why had the sickly one taken a sudden liking to him he wanted nothing more than to push him away throw away the forms and never set foot into that hospital again but for some strange and irritating reason akaashi found it difficult to deny bokuto he was trying to he truly was but he just couldnt  i dont usually text akaashi murmured he looked down at bokutos phone he couldnt look at his face im often busy keeping in contact with me wouldnt be a good idea  he watched bokutos fingers curl around the phone and his hand slowly backed away  but akaashi shocked himself with that one word he could still see bokutos hand and it had frozen in place i guess i could find some time to talk every so often he looked up and his gaze found bokutos those yellow eyes were gleaming  he entered his number swiftly and then handed the phone to bokuto the name section empty  thank you his voice was full of excitement as he proceeded to enter the name for his new contact akaashi watched closely as bokuto mouthed and typed the name  apathykun bokuto was close to saving the contact before akaashi spoke up  you dont have to put that he sighed its akaashi        the sky burned a strong orange glow as the sun set in the distance akaashi sat in bed laptop in his lap as his fingers scrolled and typed frantically   ffi    the page loaded akaashi went straight into the reading  ffi is a very rare autosomal dominant inherited prion disease of the brain akaashis eyes scanned the screen ffi has no known cure and involves progressively worsening insomnia which leads to hallucinations delirium and confusional states like that of dementia  thin lips pressed into an even thinner line his fingers remained stiff for quite some time as his eyes read the introductory paragraph over and over again  there is no known cure huh akaashi continued to read on all the people whove contracted this disease eventually die within a year or less this part was read aloud  he rubbed his face quietly of course they do akaashi leaned his head on his hand chin resting in his palm  i wonder if bokuto knows about all of this he must have looked it up at some point right it was the only normal thing to do considering how he was the one who was suffering from said disease  insomnia he thought back to the bags around bokutos eyes   all i can say is that sleeping doesnt come as easily as it used to    akaashi exhaled quickly through his nose making a sound that was almost like a laugh he read up on the symptoms and blinked gently a hand over his lips after several minutes akaashi closed his laptop and lay back on his bed he stared at the ceiling  some friend ive made  there wasnt much else to say         new text message   from bokuto sent july 29th at 1156 pm  hey i hope this isnt a bad time  akaashi lifted his head from his pillow and reached a hand out to grab his phone the bright light caused him to squint as he read the message quietly he contemplated on whether he wanted to respond or not he blinked weakly and slid his fingers down the sides of his phone a sign of weariness that he could not disobey akaashi watched as the screen went to black and it was then that he placed the phone back on his nightstand choosing to ignore the message  he couldnt sleep for about an hour after the text but ultimately slipped off to sleep  akaashi never received another message in the remaining hour that he was awake        during the next day akaashi decided to stay home he sat in his room for the majority of the day and had spent at least six hours awake until hed picked his phone up in his hands again  he looked at the message bokuto had sent him the night before his thumb aimlessly hovered over the keyboard thinking of what to type  from akaashi sent at 443pm  hello  bokuto  hey hey heyyyyy  i must have texted you while you were asleep  akaashi was dumbfounded hed never received a faster response in his life  akaashi  yeah that mustve been the case  you say hey a lot bokuto  bokuto  i know its kind of my thing  akaashi could feel bokutos enthusiasm through his text messages he spoke to akaashi as if he hadnt had a friend to text in years  bokuto  how are you today  akaashi  im well thank you just catching up on some volleyball things  bokuto  volleyball you like volleyball too we have to play together  wincing a bit akaashi squinted at his phone screen such an energetic texter bokuto was he was kind of difficult to keep up with and akaashi felt like this would be a long term sort of thing  akaashi  uh sure i mean will they let you out of the hospital  bokuto  i guess i can still walk around and get to where i have to go pretty much the only thing wrong with me is that i cant sleep  akaashi scowled he could feel the ignorance emanating off of bokutos text messages did he really think he was admitted to a hospital just because he was having trouble sleeping he knew full well the name of the disease he had so then why was he so cheerful about his entire situation why did he lack the understanding of just how serious his condition was  unless bokuto was purposely playing the fool he must have been   right    akaashis grip tightened around his phone he had to be  akaashi  then i guess ill see you at the hospital around a week or two from now i know a gymnasium we can go to  bokuto  a week or two  akaashi  is that too long a wait i can probably reschedule  bokuto  nah its alright i guess i can wait that long ive got time  ive got time the words echoed in akaashis head as if theyd been spoken aloud he stared down at the screen his brow furrowing slightly did bokuto know about the lifespan of victims with his condition was he just playing the fool after all just what kind of guy was he  indifference morphed into curiosity and said curiosity was what drew akaashi closer to his new friend  akaashi  great ill see you then        akaashi  another two weeks had passed since akaashi had seen bokuto but this time he waited outside of the hospital several meters away from the entrance  akaashi had looked up from his phone and stuffed it into his jacket pocket as the energetic hospital patient made his way across the lot in no time bokuto was standing in front of akaashi eager in every way to make it to the gymnasium  i havent set foot outside in weeks he looked around the day was strangely chilly with an occasional breeze now and then causing the browning leaves to rustle in the trees above those yellow eyes examined everything adamant with taking all of it in  bokuto tucked his hands into the pockets of his hood his shoulders hunching a puff of smoke came from him as he exhaled he was paler than before and the bags under his eyes were darker bokuto looked exhausted beyond belief yet there he stood excited to make his way to the gymnasium  akaashi hadnt even mustered his first word before bokuto snapped his head to the side to give him his undivided attention  the gymnasiums about ten minutes that way akaashi pointed down the road  then lets go bokuto power walked ahead obligating akaashi to catch up to him with a quickened pace whether he wanted to or not        the sounds of their sneakers squeaking against the gym floor was so memory inducing it caused akaashi to take a moment and reminisce on the old days as if doing so would take him back in time to when hed play volleyball every single day after school after a while he opened his eyes and sighed then moved across the court to the net hed brought along a volleyball of his own just in case they werent provided with any  what used to be your position back when you would play bokuto asked aloud finally pulling his hands from his hood pockets his head was cocked back as he surveyed the gym  akaashi bounced the ball off the floor twice setter you  bokuto grinned i was the team captain and the ace he gave a mock swing of his arm as if spiking do you think you can toss to me  of course  akaashi and bokuto carried a sort of unspoken communication with each other they had a strange relationship to say the least akaashi would answer his questions coldly with little to no emotion but bokuto would cherish these answers and retort with excitement in his tone he did not seem to take offense easily bokuto was very different from everyone else akaashi had ever met before him  where most people would detach themselves bokuto took hold and wouldnt let go being as persistent as he was energetic it was very unsettling akaashi turned away and frowned   i wouldnt have given you my number if you werent a patient    the black haired male bounced the ball again and walked over to position  this is all so nostalgic bokutos voice was filled to the brim with excitement he took several steps back to prepare himself for the toss mentally he was more than ready to spike but not so much physically  bokuto missed akaashis set twelve times  shit shit his frustration was unmasked please toss to me again he threw the ball to akaashi  theres no stopping you is there taking the ball in his hands akaashi aimed for the approximate location as to where bokuto would spike the ball he wanted for him to spike it at least once lest bokuto threw a self hateinduced panic attack  watching as bokuto ran forward akaashi set the ball perfectly it brought him back to his high school days now if only the sickly one would hit it  the sound of the palm of bokutos hand meeting the ball sounded much like an explosion akaashi flinched it had been so long since hed heard something so loud it was amazing  ha did you see that bokuto was bursting with emotion he was ecstatic i spiked it perfectly just now that toss was perfect without hesitation he ran across the court to retrieve the ball  akaashi knew that running probably wasnt the best thing that he should have been doing but he said nothing about it the ball was tossed back to him and again he got back to tossing the ball for bokuto  after three sets there was another hit and another cheer from the former ace akaashi raised his eyebrows  impressive he watched the ball roll further away from them and expected to see bokuto trailing it but instead saw nothing he turned his attention back to the only other in the room  bokuto stared off in the distance from beyond the net his face carrying a confused expression after a moment quietly he spoke  they arent really there are they the words left his mouth reluctantly  akaashi glanced in the direction of where bokuto was staring no one they were the only two in the gym he dug his thumb nail into the side of his index finger and returned his gaze to bokuto  they arent really there he had to force himself to say the mere four words  bokuto mouthed an okay before backing up several steps could you please toss to me some more  sure akaashi nodded once and that was all that bokuto needed to hear before he ran off to retrieve the ball        at some point during their walk home from the gym akaashi had agreed for bokuto to spend the night at his house  my parents are out for a month hed unconsciously said causing bokuto to go into a begging frenzy to stay over until akaashi said yes normally he would have been red with irritation from the sound of such irksome persistence but the smile that would claim bokutos face whenever he agreed to something would make akaashi forget all about how frustrated he was  he entered his home with bokuto in a matter of minutes having walked faster than usual out there the sickly one trembled like a new born animal even with the extra jacket that akaashi had offered him  its warm bokuto exhaled and shuddered once he was inside slipping off his shoes  akaashi stepped in and turned his head i would hope so he moved forward my room is this way  bokuto followed briskly he observed his surroundings once again having been fascinated by the inside of someone elses home everything was neat and placed perfectly here and there giving akaashis house a warm atmosphere to it it reminded him of his home  bokuto nearly bumped into akaashi as he stopped to enter his room  you can sit anywhere he climbed into bed and folded one leg pulling over his laptop to start it up  is your bed alright bokuto pulled off akaashis jacket  i said anywhere  bokuto plopped onto the mattress right after those words bumping his head against akaashis shoulder he recoiled with a grunt  watch it akaashi shifted to the side to give his visitor more room despite this bokuto was still close enough for their arms to touch akaashi sighed and lazily dragged his finger along the dpad do you want to watch a movie  bokuto curled in on himself and pushed his hands into his hood pocket yeah anything is fine his yellow eyes stared at the screen intently  okay akaashi opened the first movie that he had in his computers memory he pushed the laptop away and pressed play  whats it called confused bokuto glanced over at him  cloud atlas  how long is it  about three hours he kicked his legs out of bed and walked across his room to retrieve a thick blanket that sat bundled up in a rolling chair he then tossed it to bokuto once he was close enough youve been shivering use it  bokuto gathered the navy blue blanket in his arms and cautiously threw it around his shoulders it was soft thank you he kept his eyes on the screen i used to handle the cold better than this an embarrassed chuckle escaped him  exhaling through his nostrils akaashi reclaimed his seat in bed crossing his legs things happen  yeah  outside the sky above grew dark as clouds rolled in bokuto quieted himself curled up and watched on as the movie started        the sound of rain pelting hard against the window snapped akaashi back into reality he looked around in weary haste but calmed quickly once his memory had returned to him hed nodded off for a brief moment with his arms crossed and his head resting on a thick bundle of pillows with much effort he sat up to look at bokuto  the movie was well over two hours in nearing its end and bokuto lay on his side curled up and clutching the blanket with what little strength he had left his eyes were halflidded and glued to the screen his face void of emotion it almost looked as if he were asleep  bokuto akaashis voice was groggy  slowly his yellow eyes scrolled to the side to catch akaashis gaze he turned his head weakly and his body along with it  im sorry ive watched this movie so many times i actually fell asleep akaashi dragged a hand down his face  dont be sorry bokuto found himself smiling its your house you sleep if you want to  not if i have a visitor over  its fine im not just some visitor after all were friends bokutos head lolled to the side directing his attention back to the movie you were out for about an hour  akaashi heaved a sigh he rubbed the back of his neck  i envy you i wish i could sleep like that again  guilt bubbled up within akaashis chest hed realized just how rude that was falling asleep so easily in front of a person whos biggest struggle was just that  how insensitive of me he furrowed his brow mentally scolding himself  dont cry over it bokuto shifted as he lay down sticking a leg out to kick akaashi the movie kept me company its very good kind of confusing but good ill have to watch it again  strange bokuto was such a strange one he seemed to be unfazed by many things and blatant about others blurting sentences out that didnt seem to have much thought behind them akaashi doubted that hed ever have bokuto over again so hearing him say ill have to watch it again didnt sit too well with him  akaashi twisted his lips to the side and decided to bring up something else are you tired  exhausted bokuto answered honestly  close your eyes for the time being akaashi kicked his legs out of bed with much effort and stood on his feet ill get us some water he left the room quickly leaving bokuto by his lonesome  after several seconds hed returned to see that bokuto had changed his position in bed entirely he lay on his back with his head on some of akaashis pillows his hands rested on his stomach the dark blanket surrounding him from behind but slipping off just enough for his torso to be exposed his head rested against the bed slumped to the side facing away from akaashi  again if he hadnt known any better akaashi would have figured that bokuto was already fast asleep he approached his bedside silently the room was dark apart from the soft orange glow that his lamp gave off  he set the drinks down and shuffled into bed as if trying not to wake the other lying on his back he stared at the ceiling  no words were exchanged for what seemed like forever before akaashi spoke up  how does it feel to not be able to sleep  bokutos answer was delayed awful he turned his head in the opposite direction facing akaashi now i can barely keep my eyes open by day and can barely keep them closed by night he snorted in laughter  does it frustrate you  it did at first when i didnt understand why but now im kind of okay with it a hand reached up to push through his own messy locks i still miss it though sleeping dreaming  akaashi watched bokuto listening to every word he said  i used to have some insane dreams too especially before certain volleyball matches he laughed again louder this time id dream that i messed up during a spike and then id wake up fuming and would constantly tell myself that i was the best  do you still think that you are the best emerald eyes searched bokutos own for an honest answer  he sighed his response with a grin yeah bokuto closed his eyes after that one hand resting on the side of his head he was obviously tired showing signs of exhaustion with every small move he made  akaashi grew silent and knitted his fingers together on his stomach his head relaxing into his pillow the both of them didnt exchange any words after that ending the conversation just as suddenly as it had started        two hours had passed since their last words towards each other yet akaashi still lay awake in bed unknown to bokuto he watched him quietly through almost closed eyelids his thick lashes being enough to hide the fact that he was still awake tired but awake  akaashi couldnt sleep but it wasnt because of his unfamiliarity with bokuto that caused this he couldnt sleep because of his honest fascination with him  bokuto would lay still for quite a while his head tilted to the side with one hand on his stomach and the other at his side when he was like this akaashi would think that he was resting and he would almost believe that thought until bokuto would twitch awake again his body jerking him from what little relaxation he tried to achieve  at first akaashi thought nothing of it bokuto would wince and snap back to reality the way someone would when they dreamt they were falling but akaashi knew full well that such a thing wasnt possible with bokutos condition it made akaashi pity him to say the least  three times bokuto jolted awake involuntarily and three times he covered his eyes with his forearm and heaved a quiet sigh akaashi refused to have reacted to those moments hoping to spare his visitor the embarrassment of him having seen that he intended on closing his eyes and falling asleep for real afterwards but after having felt his mattress shake for the fourth time he opened his eyes  akaashi lifted himself onto his elbows bokuto he whispered  alarmed he snapped around quickly his face looked both shocked and exhausted at the same time akaashi im  dont his voice a mere murmur akaashi moved closer to bokuto then resumed to lie down on his back his head slightly elevated with the pillows that sat behind him dont apologize  mildly embarrassed bokuto looked away and rubbed his arms  come akaashi beckoned for his visitor  turning his attention back to him bokuto met akaashis gaze he wore a confused expression wondering just what the other had meant by that word  i said come he motioned for bokuto to come closer get over here as akaashi said this he held out an arm as if readying himself for some sort of hug  obeying with hesitance bokuto shifted towards akaashi and lay against him fitting into the curve of his arm it was no doubt that he was larger than akaashi but that didnt stop him from fitting in just right  bokutos head lay against akaashis shoulder akaashis arm cautiously wrapped itself around bokutos broad shoulders  neither of them said a word  minutes passed and in time akaashi could feel bokuto relaxing against him the signs of fatigue finally wearing him down his head slumped against his shoulder and both his hands rested on his stomach he was trying trying so hard to fit in that small amount of sleep that would get him through the next day and akaashi wanted to help  as much as he didnt want to believe it akaashi wanted so badly to help   why    akaashi watched as one of bokutos hands twitched involuntarily and to his dismay it wouldnt stop slowly he reached a hand out and closed it over the twitching one his four fingers fitting into bokutos palm in seconds his hand was calm again  akaashi inhaled quietly he watched as bokutos chest rose and fell with each breath that kept him alive his breathing was controlled much like one of a persons who was actually asleep pursing his lips akaashi let his head fall back into the pillows he turned his head to the side towards bokutos he could smell his faint scent he smelled sort of like a hospital           akaashi made his way to the hospital for the umpteenth time that week his hands in his jacket pockets and his nose burying into the burgundy knit scarf that protected him from the chilly weather  it had been two months since bokutos visit over his home and ever since then akaashi found that making his way to the hospital had become a daily routine for him and even if he didnt show up he would still spend his days sending messages to bokuto be it text email or the occasional video chat  he exhaled through his nose and entered the hospital greeted the woman at the front desk who now knew him by name and removed the scarf from around his neck akaashi already knew where he had to go  he ascended those familiar steps said hello to the familiar faces and rounded that familiar corner that he knew would lead him to bokutos room another breath escaped him slow and casual but hed soon learned to hold his breath when he noticed another person sitting outside in the hall several feet from the room where visitors could spend their time  akaashi eyeballed the small male for a long second knowing that he wouldnt look up to catch him his head hung low and his attention belonged only to the handheld system that entertained him  normally akaashi would have walked away that instant in order to pay bokuto a visit but as he neared his room he could hear two voices coming from within one of the voices belonged to bokuto the other he had no clue akaashi paused and gripped the strap of his bag hesitating he turned pivoting on one foot to stare back at the small one who sat by his lonesome feeling that it would be rude to interrupt bokutos conversation with whoever the other person was akaashi strode over to the seats and sat one chair away from the gaming stranger  akaashi tapped his fingers quietly against his pants   are you here to see bokuto koutarou akaashis asked in a leveled tone  no my friend is the other spoke in a quiet voice low and brooding or maybe not brooding but more along the lines of apathetic  apathykun the nickname popped into akaashis head for a brief second he wasnt too sure why  is your friend a friend of bokutos  yeah an old friend he pressed pause on his psp and tapped one end of it against his open palm they used to play volleyball together they go back a couple of years  akaashi leaned back in his seat ah i see he felt the need to keep most of his questions at bay his company did not seem like the type to socialize so openly so he figured simple inquiries would do just fine especially if he kept them to a minimum  may i ask your name akaashi took a shot at it  a small thumb rubbed at the systems screen to remove a smudge he looked up gazed at akaashi past his bleached blonde bangs and straightened his back in the slightest way possible  kozume kenma  akaashi keiji he felt like he could enjoy kozumes company what with how his words lacked all form of emotion its nice to meet you kozume  kenma is fine he looked back down at the game screen likewise  akaashi nodded glad to have made an acquaintance and would have relaxed into his seat if not for the sudden disembodied voice that startled him soon after kenmas sentence  hey kenma who are you talking to as if straight from a cartoon out popped a tall male from bokutos room with stark black hair that both hung over his face and stuck out in all directions he carried a look on his face that made him seem more sinister than sincere and his eyes flitted from kenma to akaashi and then back to kenma  this is akaashi i just met him his words were as straightforward as they were indifferent  akaashi bokutos voice rang out from the room this time akaashi didnt even have to see his face to know that bokuto was beaming hes here is he here  i am akaashi rose from his seat to enter the room but instead found bokuto standing at the door in seconds his eyes wide with surprise he was thinner than before a large flannel shirt fitting him loosely he had probably lost a bit overtwenty pounds in the two months that passed  akaashi frowned get back into bed you shouldnt be  bokuto didnt allow him to finish his sentence as he embraced akaashi suddenly i didnt think you were going to make it today though hed gotten thinner his arms still had some power to them he squeezed akaashi mashing him closer until he could barely breathe  akaashis eyebrows knit together i told you i would he all but murmured against bokutos shoulder  whats this the taller dark haired male gestured to them i come to visit and im barely paid attention to but when he comes along hes given the whole package  bokuto pulled away to face his smirking friend relax he then turned his attention to akaashi this is kuroo a close friend of mine  he cocked his head to the side nice to meet you akaashi ive heard a lot about you in the short hour that ive been here  nodding once akaashi acknowledged kuroos words but did not know how to respond to them all he had to offer was a the pleasure is mine before moving forward to try and usher bokuto back into his room  hey hey bokuto resisted standing firm in place we were actually just talking about stepping outside  well i brought it up just as a suggestion but then he got really excited kuroo scratched the back of his head so we were going to step outside for a minute or two in order to get this owl to shut up  ive been cooped up in this place for too long i havent gone outside in days the discomfort could be heard in bokutos voice if there was one thing that akaashi had learned about bokuto in the little time that hed known him it was that he wasnt too fond of staying locked up indoors maybe taking him outside for a while would do him some good  akaashi looked down the hall lets go then to the garden out in the back  everyone came to an unspoken agreement after the one sentence kuroo started down the hall bokuto trailing after him akaashi followed after knowing that kenma was nearby as he walked he stared at the backs of the two men in front of him they both seemed to be the same height but akaashi couldnt help but realize that bokuto looked just a bit smaller        a mere two minutes outside had turned into two hours  akaashi shared a bench with kenma the both of them had sat down long ago leaving bokuto and kuroo to their own business as they wandered about and waved their arms around in their animated way of speaking he found it strange how bokuto was the one walking around when he was the sick one out of the lot he furrowed his brow and exhaled heavily his eyes looking down he stared at his knees intensely before kenma spoke up  you dont like to see him like that do you  akaashi lifted his head and looked to his side he eyed the blonde one for quite a while kenma didnt give him a chance to respond  i dont like to see him like that either its why i didnt want to come along but kuroo insisted kenmas unconcerned tone contradicted his words but something told akaashi that he meant everything he was saying  were you ever friends with bokuto akaashi lifted his head in subtle interest  more like acquaintances our teams would face each other often whenever we did kuroo and bokuto would meet up afterwards and spend time together im usually around kuroo so he shrugged with little energy i sort of got to know him through kuroos company hes an okay guy loud though  bokutos disembodied laughter rang throughout the garden as if to prove kenma right  akaashi almost smiled so how are you taking all of this if i may ask  im kenmas lips puckered in thought im taking it well or at least i think i am im trying to detach myself its another reason why i didnt want to pay bokuto any visits he looked down his hair hanging over his face theres something about bokuto that doesnt sit well with me  confused and mildly shocked akaashi made a face is there something wrong with him has he ever done anything bad  not to my knowledge but even if he has thats not what i meant kenma rubbed his nose with his sleeve it doesnt matter if youve never met bokuto before or if you havent seen him in ten days or ten weeks or ten months or ten years if you ever interact with him in even the slightest youll be reminded of just how good a person he really is  akaashi stared at kenma speechless  hes genuine kind and at times infantile but thats what makes him so likeable i suppose he drags you back in he praises others while shouting that hes the best at everything he does its ridiculous  looking away slowly akaashi watched as bokuto and kuroo reappeared in the distance they were still wrapped up in whatever conversation they were having  kuroo looks happy now but he wasnt then kenma almost murmured the words akaashi turned to catch a glimpse of him but he stared off in the distance his eyes not focusing on anything in particular blinking akaashi turned his attention back to kuroo and bokuto  five weeks ago he was in shambles he didnt want to talk to anyone he only accepted my company i was the only one willing to give it to him he continued to stare on as he talked that was when he learned about the disease this entire past month hasnt been any different for him though he almost didnt want to come today either no one likes to find out that someone they care about is sick much less diagnosed with a disease that cant be cured  bokuto and kuroo continued to talk animatedly the both of them out of earshot  bokuto is starting to look less and less like his old self too he used to be thicker he used to be bigger than kuroo but now hes the one whos smaller kuroos the bigger one kuroos the heavier one it doesnt it doesnt make any sense  pursing his lips into a thin line akaashi looked down and noticed that kenma had laced his fingers together he pulled and tugged at them restlessly his hands showed what his face dared not  akaashi figured it was safe to say that bokuto had already begun to pull kenma back in it was an awful thing to do but akaashi knew full well that none of it was intentional on bokutos part all he had to do was talk to someone and in an instant they would be involved in bokutos lively shenanigans once again  akaashi knew this the same thing happened to him some two and a half months ago if he had known that sending simple text messages would have turned into daily hospital visits then he would have never handed over his cell number this was not what he wanted he wanted healthy friends that he could talk to on a regular basis not one sick friend who hed have to invest personal and emotional time into akaashi swallowed thickly and crossed his hands rubbing one thumb over the other he stared at bokuto and found it difficult to look away with a heavy heart he spoke  i wish i never met him  a cool breeze passed through the garden just then and in the distance bokuto held on tight to the burgundy knit scarf around his neck to keep warm        in time kuroo and kenma found that it was time for them to make their way back home kuroo bid bokuto farewell for the time being while kenma made his way downstairs to exit the building he didnt seem like one to say goodbye  or hello  for that matter so both akaashi and bokuto didnt pay any mind to it  kuroo finally left the room after four minutes or so having forgotten that he was supposed to leave in the first place he waved and jogged out knowing that if he didnt hurry hed have to spend several more minutes trying to catch up to a wandering kenma  standing at the side of bokutos bed akaashi glanced to the open door that led to the hallway  your friend is a lot like you  anything but bokuto retorted sitting upright in bed hes a bit more of an ass to say the least he chuckled and rubbed at his face wearily  the sound of bokutos laughter caused akaashi to turn his head back to him it was a reaction that akaashi was not expecting in the least but he played off his surprise and only managed an i see  bokuto gazed at akaashi almost in wonder why are you standing take a seat he pat the empty space next to him animatedly  no its alright i was actually thinking of taking my leave soon as well  what why the disappointment in his voice was clear youve only been here for like thirty minutes  akaashi scratched his head its been over three hours actually  thats the same thing bokuto moved closer to where akaashi was standing all the while still sitting in bed i spoke to kuroo most of the time so it doesnt count  what doesnt akaashi took an unnoticeable step back  the three hours he was getting frustrated im very bad at measuring time now too if you havent noticed three hours feels like seven hours sometimes but three hours can also feel like seven minutes i may not be as sharp as i used to but that whole time flies when youre having fun rule still applies to me even today  so three hours is nothing akaashi muttered  exactly bokutos eyes lit up again  akaashi avoided looking into them i understand but i still have to go he avoided looking at bokuto altogether i would stay if it were up to me ive just got something to take care of but ill be sure to visit you tomorrow  bokuto didnt make a sound he pressed his lips into a thin line and fell backwards on his bed he probably had a thousand things to say but he kept them all at bay and instead rolled onto his side facing away from akaashi  he was shocked akaashi never knew that bokuto was one to suddenly sulk on a dime he looked around and frowned and figured it would be best to take his leave  ill see you tomorrow  do you want your scarf back the question came out of the blue despite him being the one who asked bokuto held onto it tightly  akaashi watched him and zipped up his jacket yeah i do  in dismay bokuto sat up in bed and slowly reached around his neck to pull off the warm piece of cloth he took his time the thought of removing it killing him faster than the disease itself  but i also want you to hold onto it  the words had come as such a shock to bokuto that hed paused and looked up at akaashi his hands tensed relaxed and rested against his neck you do  yes akaashi managed the faintest of smiles please hold onto it bokuto  at that moment he turned away and walked off feeling he wouldnt be able to leave if hed lasted one more second in the room        akaashi woke with a start that same night his strangled shouts having pulled him from his sleep hed flinched hard and sat up quickly closing his hand over his mouth to subdue the almost hysteric sounds that came from him his breathing was heavy his heart rate quicker than usual akaashi could feel his heart pounding in his throat making it difficult to swallow  sh shit  that had been the fifth time that month where akaashi had to tear himself out of another nightmare they made him feel nauseous to a point where he had to sit up in bed and swallow deep slow breaths in order to cool himself down and he did just that reaching his hands up to rub at his eyes before taking a tense look around his room  exhaling heavily akaashi turned to look at the desk near his bed his phone was there hesitating for only a second he reached his hand out and took the device into his hands when the screen lit up a text message from bokuto waited there for him  sleep well akaashi it had been sent two hours ago  akaashi swiped and unlocked his phone with trembling hands  from akaashi sent at 247am  are you there  bokuto  yeah akaashi i thought you fell asleep  akaashi had to wait almost a minute for bokutos response it was the longest minute hed ever been forced to sit through  akaashi  i woke up nightmares  bokuto  nightmare you had a nightmare was it bad  akaashi  well it managed to wake me up  bokuto  the quiet kind of wake up  akaashi  no more like the cliched kind where you sit up in bed in a cold sweat  bokuto  are you calming down are you feeling better  akaashi stared at the text message and let out a shaking sigh judging by his still trembling hands he knew he wasnt  akaashi  yeah im just a little shaken  bokuto  i dont believe you on that yeah part  akaashi  im fine  bokuto  alright well well just see about that  furrowing his brow akaashi stared at his phone screen and lay his head down sideways it wasnt like bokuto to question what he said in such a straightforward fashion  akaashi  theres nothing to see  he pressed send and watched the phone carefully waiting for the small ellipses to appear on the lower left side of the screen but instead he was greeted with nothing he didnt get a response nor did he see any signs of responding  akaashi frowned and left his phone screen alone to dim and blacken he held it in his shaking hands and closed his eyes in an attempt to try and find sleep again it was difficult however as each time he tried to drift off to sleep that unnerving fear of having the same dream would jerk him back awake akaashi groaned softly and covered his face    bzzt    akaashis phone vibrated against his forehead he flinched and pulled his hand away to stare at the screen  bokuto  look outside no  what akaashi kicked his legs out of bed and strode to his window impossible he pulled apart the blinds and looked down  out in the dead of night stood bokuto with the burgundy knit scarf around his neck a jacket jeans and slippers he looked up and grinned and waved wildly in akaashis direction  akaashis eyes widened no no no no he pulled away from the windowsill and ran out of his room straight downstairs and to the front door he threw it open and faced bokuto who was jogging to him with a smile and a shiver in each step  may i come in  no no were  why not  were going back to the hospital right now im taking you back akaashi reached his arms out and pushed bokuto away  what no bokuto refused to budge he pushed akaashi back this time i just came from there  exactly because you belong there akaashi felt that his words were a bit bitter but he had no other way of telling bokuto the truth youre sick you need medical attention  so i cant sleep bokuto swatted akaashis hands away whats the big deal  its more than that he exerted more force into his arms getting bokuto to take a step back youve had two panic attacks this week already and your hallucinations are getting worse my home is not a place for you to be right now  i get panic attacks when youre not around bokuto answered simplemindedly and my hallucinations arent all that bad  akaashi clenched his jaw behind a mildly irritated face stop trying to act like this isnt such a big deal you may not think it is but i he paused and reached his arms out to get in another shove lets just go  i dont want to bokuto grabbed akaashis hands with his own  bokuto stop  i dont want to go back  how did you even sneak out  by sneaking out they dont pay much attention to me anyways  akaashi yanked his hands away and stared at bokuto as much as it infuriated him he knew that bokuto wasnt going to go anywhere unless he let him into his home first he swallowed thickly  get inside akaashi stepped to the side  bokutos eyes did the familiar light up thing as he bounded into akaashis home he removed his slippers and waited at the entrance for his friend to enter akaashi stepped in and shut the door behind him  you chose the perfect night akaashi said bitterly as he hobbled up the stairs my parents arent home  its not like i wouldve made any noise bokuto all but shouted following after him  akaashi sighed ill get you back to the hospital by seven in the morning  fine by me imagine the looks on their faces when they see me coming in from the outside imagine their faces when they notice im not even in my room bokuto was elated  akaashi entered his room and shut the door behind bokuto im going straight to sleep  but i thought you had that nightmare bokuto stood at the side of akaashis bed  i did he paused for a moment  is that why you came here because of the nightmare  bokuto stared at akaashi because you said you were okay and i knew you werent  akaashi was at a loss for words he returned bokutos gaze then looked down quickly afterwards a hand tugged at his shirt weakly i see he reached a hand out to turn on the lamp that sat on his nightstand  taking a seat on the edge of the bed bokuto rubbed the back of his neck what was the dream about  akaashi sat in bed and wrapped a sheet around himself he tossed the navy blue one to bokuto remembering how fond he was of it the last time hed come over he watched as bokuto gathered it up in his arms and threw it around himself he then stared at akaashi waiting for his response  he sighed i was drowning his hands picked at the small lint rolls that stuck to his sheet drowning in something black sort of like tar i was fighting and trying to get out but i had no power over it whatsoever i was so weak and itd gotten to the point where i could barely breath my face was the only thing sticking out akaashi cocked his head back to demonstrate this with his finger tapping his chin  i was struggling but in the end i couldnt move i was shouting but no sound came out no one could hear me no one was around akaashi shrugged the liquid started flooding into my mouth and nose and it wasnt until i was suffocating that i forced myself awake  akaashi didnt say another word afterwards he only bundled himself up in the sheets that surrounded him he turned his head to look out the window eyeing the moon timidly  shifting in his seat bokuto pulled himself closer to akaashi one hand grasping the blanket that had been given to him  akaashi remained in place with the thought in mind that bokuto would respect his personal space and sit a foot or two away from him but to his apparent surprise bokuto leaned his head on akaashis shoulder and slipped an arm around him  akaashi squirmed in discomfort what are you doing  comforting bokuto replied lifting his head isnt that what humans do  akaashi watched him carefully dont talk like youre not one  bokuto chortled quietly and placed his head back on akaashis shoulder they didnt speak for a moment and the room was filled with the hushed sounds of the outside  hey  what  lets watch cloud atlas  no akaashi shook his head  bokuto grumbled to himself why not dont you have it in your laptop  i do but i dont want to watch it its a long movie and ive watched it about seven times already  well if youve watched it seven times then why not watch it an eighth time  because its three in the morning and i want to fit some sleep into my schedule by the time that movie ends itll be six then ill have to walk you to the hospital before the doctors find out youre missing and lose their minds  a laugh escaped bokuto the sound curling his lips into a smile what if theyve already found out  then that would be a problem  and then theyd turn my room upside down in an attempt to find me  thatd be a tough mess to clean up  turning his head bokuto looked at akaashi everything you say is so straightforward why is that  i dont know akaashi inhaled slowly its just how i am sometimes i think im funny but people never laugh at my jokes  bokuto snorted when have you ever tried to make a joke  when i said that it would be a tough mess for them to clean up akaashi sounded genuinely confused didnt that come off as remotely funny  bokuto couldnt help but guffaw his head tilting back that was your idea of a joke  youre too loud be quiet akaashi shoved his visitor lightly despite this it only seemed to make bokuto laugh even harder akaashi pursed his lips in frustration but this look quickly vanished as a small laugh fell from his lips  well youre laughing now he tried to hide his smile so i guess i am pretty good at being funny  bokuto glanced at him yeah but for all the wrong reasons his laughter died down along with akaashis you know i dont think ive ever heard you laugh or seen you smile for that matter  shrugging one shoulder akaashi grabbed his phone well now you have  bokuto looked over at the phone screen what are you doing  setting an alarm for six am akaashi set his phone down and leaned back slowly resting the back of his head against his pillow bokuto followed his arm still around him  this is strange he stared up at the ceiling and sighed why do i let him do this   akaashis head slumped to the side in bokutos direction  i hope you dont mind me sleeping he whispered the words  of course i dont i showed up to your house unannounced at three in the morning youve got all the right to sleep  i just hope it isnt rude  it isnt bokutos arm unconsciously squeezed akaashi closer to his side  alright he closed his eyes good night akaashi pulled his arms in close wrapping the sheets around himself  see you in three hours bokuto whispered  complete and utter silence befell them afterwards akaashi had kept his eyes closed for quite a while trying to fall into a deep sleep but found that he couldnt or at least not as quickly as he thought he could he kept his breathing controlled and steady for about forty minutes he looked sound asleep but was actually drifting between the real world and the dream realm  there was silence and then there was a sound a subtle gentle sound the sound of someone cautiously moving their arm when they didnt wish to wake someone  akaashi remained in his faux sleeping position feeling that it would take much more of an effort for him to open his eyes and check around than to stay dormant and so he continued to try and grasp sleep expecting nothing from the noise  it was because of this that he was so surprised when he felt a gentle sensation against his forehead it took all of his power not to flinch when hed felt the unfamiliar touch  they were fingers hesitant fingers that ghosted over akaashis forehead in order to push a loose strand of hair away  keeping his eyes closed akaashi took in the feeling of this he could sense the heavy amount of reluctance in each movement that bokutos hand carried out  bokuto was afraid to wake akaashi so much so that his hands trembled slightly whenever hed push akaashis bangs away  slowly but gradually akaashis heart rate picked up his hands twitched once and he moved closer leaning into bokutos touch this backfired however as the others hand quickly withdrew akaashi relaxed then keeping the sleeping act alive  bokuto did not move a muscle after having seen akaashi stir the last thing he wanted to do was wake him up so they lay in silence for minutes on end akaashi figured that bokuto would keep to himself for the rest of the night so he put his focus back to trying to sleep he held the same position and felt himself dozing off  im sorry the words were barely a whisper and they came without warning it almost sounded as if bokuto were talking to himself  akaashi remained still and silent   i never meant to drag you into my life  bokuto inhaled all that he could akaashi felt his chest rise he could practically hear the frown in his voice  i know that im unbearable i know that im a lost cause i know that you know that too and yet you still stick by me  he paused for a moment then spoke up again his voice was a soft tremor  so thank you  bokuto had nothing more to say after that he lay his cheek on the top of akaashis head and kept still daring not to wake him  but akaashi now couldnt find it in himself to sleep bokutos words haunted him and they repeated themselves over and over in his mind   he swallowed once hoping to get rid of the lump in his throat           after that night things had only gone downhill from then  akaashi took a glance out the window only to instantly throw on his clothes and toss his bag over his shoulders he jogged downstairs slipped his shoes on and was out the door in seconds making his way down the familiar route to the hospital above the clouds were dense and they gathered quickly casting a dark shroud over akaashis path he zipped his jacket up to shield himself from the harsh winds that came his way and advanced forward there was definitely a storm coming his way so akaashi knew that bokuto would need him  a month and sixteen days had passed since bokutos final visit to akaashis home and once hed been taken back to the hospital the doctors and nurses made sure to keep a closer eye on him and with good reason not only was bokuto the kind of guy to sneak out when no one was watching but his condition had quickly begun to worsen without warning before then he would normally lose several pounds a week but ever since the night hed snuck out his weight loss could only be described as alarming in the span of a little over a month bokuto had gone from a general onehundred and fifty pounds to a mere ninetyseven pounds last time theyd weighed him the drastic weight loss was awful enough but as if to add insult to injury bokutos worsening condition also made it increasingly difficult for him to walk move and speak  akaashi frowned heavily as he entered the hospital he made his way up the same path walking swiftly and without pause that was until he saw a familiar face  kuroo akaashi stopped in his tracks in front of bokutos room  the black haired male looked up from his hands he faked a smile hey akaashi right long time  yeah im he turned his head is there someone in there he didnt wait for kuroo to respond and glanced into bokutos room surely enough he noticed kenma sitting in the seat next to bokutos bed his back was facing the door and bokuto seemed to have all of his attention on him  will kenma allow me to enter the room  kuroo rubbed the lower part of his face with his hand nope he leaned back in his chair take a seat kenma usually isnt the kind of person to speak to people one on one so i think youd better leave em both alone  inhaling deeply akaashi lingered in place then sat down in the empty seat next to kuroo  you seem a bit anxious kuroo looked at akaashi sideways  i am theres a storm coming bokuto doesnt do well with those  ah kuroo looked at the ceiling as if he would be able to see the clouds from there i hadnt noticed that one was rolling in he slowly lowered his head and folded his arms didnt think you knew that about him  akaashi turned his head to face kuroo was he ever fond of them  dont think so in the past hed always get sort of tense and paranoid whenever a storm would pass over head but that was kind of it now i bet he suffers panic attacks because of them  akaashi looked down he does storms trigger them  kuroo made a grunting noise and had nothing more to say on the subject akaashi figured he should stay quiet too he knit his fingers together and kept his eyes down anticipating when the first boom of thunder would sound he would have to close bokutos blinds and take his mind off of it somehow show him a movie or play a game with him that would result in him to calm down quickly akaashi rubbed the back of his neck hastily and closed his eyes  ninetyseven fucking pounds  startled akaashi opened his eyes and glanced in kuroos direction he glowered at nothing in particular  im sorry  ninetyseven pounds right thats how much he supposedly weighs now  once akaashi realized what kuroo was talking about he instantly felt his spirits fall yes  fucking bullshit he swore without a filter  wincing akaashi turned his head away hed only spoken to kuroo once before and they barely exchanged any words he didnt know how to deal with him now so he remained silent he twisted his fingers and pursed his lips wary of what kuroo would say next  all of this is so ugh why the hell did this have to happen to him and at such an early damn age too he hissed the words under his breath openly frustrated with the situation he turned twenty only three months ago  akaashi lowered his head its not fair  its not kuroo echoed the words in agreement but here we are and here he is  kuroo rubbed his elbow irate and sighed in defeat  im not coming back to visit him anymore not after this ive seen enough he turned to look at akaashi keep him company from now on i dont know how you do it but when youre around him you help him forget  akaashi kept his eyes down he wouldnt show this but kuroos words had hit him harder than he could ever imagine they sat heavily in the pit of his stomach churning and pestering him urging him to throw up but he only swallowed and kept his composure just as hed been doing since the day he met bokuto  akaashi reached his hand up to rub the back of his neck roughly administering a feeling of discomfort to one area in order to ignore the pain that threatened to swallow his heart he closed his eyes in a slow blink and kept his breathing quiet  having been neck deep in his own sorrows kuroo was blind to akaashis he forced himself to stand after some time tapping his fingers against his pants  keep doing what youre doing his voice was low  akaashi nodded in response  of course i couldnt stop even if i tried  a biting chuckle escaped kuroo  yeah aint that the horror of it all he rubbed his chin and stalked his way down the hall keep in touch akaashi  of course he repeated the same phrase finding that it was difficult to search for words at the time he watched as kuroo walked away far enough for small details to become blurred he only looked like a tall thin black mass now as he stood near the stairway he was waiting for kenma but akaashi wondered why he hadnt waited for him in the seat that he was initially sitting in  just then as akaashi bit down on the inside of his lower lip he turned his head in time to catch a glimpse of kenma lowering his head towards bokuto it wasnt necessarily a bow it seemed more along the lines of an act of affection or at least as affectionate as kenma could get which wasnt much  he touched his forehead to bokutos shoulder which only earned a laugh from him bokuto talked quietly in response to kenma gave a nod and smiled  he never seemed to stop smiling  once he saw this kenma picked himself up from his seat put his hands at his side and bowed his head he didnt last another second in bokutos company before he turned and briskly walked out of the room he kept his head down and played the fool pretending he didnt see akaashi in seconds kenma was down the hall and making his way down the stairs having completely ignored kuroo as well  kuroo didnt seem surprised in the slightest he only waved goodbye at a staring akaashi before following his small friend down the stairs  hesitantly akaashi barely managed to wave back before he heard his name being called from that all too familiar room by that all too familiar voice  he directed his attention to a grinning bokuto who eagerly sat up in bed  akaashi almost smiled back and he would have too if it hadnt been for the thunder that sounded its arrival from above he watched as bokutos smile faded instantly his eyes having gone from half lidded to wide in a second his hands squeezed tightly around the navy blue blanket that enveloped him  akaashi  i know he walked ahead quickly straight into the room he pushed the chair away and found bokutos side in bed  frail shaking fingers pushed through his own black and white hair in an attempt to calm himself down but another thunder clap sounded louder that time bokuto flinched hard enough to make the bed shake  ffuck his voice broke in terror  look at me its going to be fine akaashi spoke in a calm slow voice his hand took bokutos own and he held it gently it was cold and shook in short bursts you will get through this you always do  staring down wideeyed at the floor of the hospital room bokuto fought to find words  akaash ddont bokuto struggled with his breathing  dont what  dont lleleave mme  i wont leave you he moved closer his other hand taking hold of bokutos just breathe with me  bokuto nodded frantically and forced himself to comply with akaashi as he always did he was the only person who could get him through those horrible moments after all  heavy raindrops pelted against the window as bokutos frantic sounds filled the room akaashi was glad to have made it in time that had been one of bokutos worst attacks yet        hey akaashi  hm  when do you think it will snow  i dont know snow falls at random  yeah but do you think it will snow soon or maybe january  i hope so that would be nice tokyo needs a little more snow now and then  yeah yeah when it falls i want to go out and stand in it  akaashi sat cross legged in the seat adjacent to bokutos bed he looked up at the sickly one when hed said those words trying to meet his gaze but ultimately finding no yellow eyes to look into bokuto had his head turned away  he was staring outside at the white clouds that shrouded the skies mesmerized by just how colorless it made everything seem it was one of those white days as bokuto liked to call them so he paid much more attention to the world beyond the glass than he did to his own confined life in the hospital bokuto breathed in deeply the sound filling the small space around them the bedsheets crumpled beneath his hands  are you sure you should be going out in the cold like that  i think i can handle it  akaashi didnt want to bring up the fact that bokuto probably would no longer possess the ability to walk by the time any snow did get a chance to fall so he kept his mouth shut he rubbed his hands together weakly and tilted his head to the side  i guess you can just as long as youre feeling better  bokuto scoffed it was a quiet sound  i am stop asking already that was six days ago  i know but it was bad  it passed bokuto turned his head the pillow crumpling under his neck he looked at akaashi with heavy lidded eyes he was extremely pale and somehow thinner than before but he kept that same smile on his face im fine now  akaashi couldnt help but smile back at him he leaned his chin against the palm of his hand and chortled  or at least as fine as you can get  bokuto stared at akaashi sharply his lips quivered before he could form his words  shut up a stronger laugh broke out from him rattling his body as he lay down in bed i look like shit i know  akaashi found himself laughing along with him his quiet chuckle was louder than bokutos wholehearted laugh  you dont you dont look like shit he tried to hide his grin with his hand but it was still visible from the gaps between his fingers  bokuto reached a hand out aimlessly trying to swat akaashis own hand away he tried to aim for it at the very least but found it difficult to still he continued  dont cover that  cover what  your smile  why it isnt anything spe  i barely ever see it bokutos fingers touched at akaashis knuckles that was enough for akaashi to remove his hand from in front his mouth slowly moving it to rest it over his chin he smiled down at him  bokutos eyes stared forward with an engrossed gaze his yellow hues taking a mental picture of what he probably would never see again many words dashed through his mind but he could only think of three that would be best for him to say to akaashi he tried to open his mouth to say them but he performed another action instead unconsciously his hand grasped akaashis own and he dragged it down with his lack of strength causing both of them to startle bokutos eyes widened  i i thought you would hold it up  it was sudden akaashi stifled a laugh it caught me off guard  i didnt mean to  its alright he smoothed his thumb over bokutos knuckles im holding it now  silently and almost in fascination bokuto stared at akaashi once again longer this time before he looked up then down then away he turned his head towards the window away from akaashi he couldnt face him  pursing his lips timidly akaashi ceased to speak he studied the back of bokutos head eying the messy strands of black and white hair that overlapped each other his green eyes then fell to study his paling skin his veins were easily noticeable now and they bulged from beneath his flesh whenever he moved akaashis eyes lowered focusing on the arm that was attached to the hand that he was holding  he studied the small needle that was lodged into bokutos forearm eyed the thin tube that was attached to this and followed it up to the bag of iv fluid that hung above his head  whatever was left of akaashis smile faded  ever since bokutos last panic attack it had suddenly become more difficult for him to control his words movements and actions altogether such a task as easy as swallowing was now a problem for bokuto too and after many failed attempts at keeping his food down or getting it to go down in the first place the nurses found it would be best if bokuto received nourishment the only other way possible and that was through a tube  over the span of the six days akaashi found that the only things bokuto could manage to swallow were small snacks like grapes ice cubes and pocky sticks that were specifically strawberry flavored other than those things bokuto found it nearly impossible to stomach anything else his only other choice was to lie there and accept whatever it was the iv liquid had to offer him  looking back to bokuto he was relieved to see that he still had his attention on the window at some time while akaashi was spacing out the blue blanket that surrounded bokuto had been pulled up just below his chin with only his arm hanging out to hold onto akaashis hand bokutos breathing was quiet and his hand never really remained still for a long time it would shake every so often and each time it did akaashi would squeeze lightly in response this was their unspoken communication  it was akaashis way of letting bokuto know that everything would be alright and this would always comfort him no matter the situation they were in  they both found it easier to believe in that lie than to accept the truth of what was to come        on the numbingly cold day that was january 3rd at 804 pm snow had fallen for the first time that year bokuto was the first to notice this but had also been the last to say anything about it  it wasnt until akaashi looked up from his laptop screen that he realized it was snowing heavily outside his eyes lit up intent on informing bokuto but when he turned his head to get a look at him instead of being greeted by an over enthusiastic friend he was presented with an unfazed expression upon bokutos weary face  akaashi frowned  bokuto dont you see it  looking up from the laptop screen bokuto directed his attention to akaashi  wh  the snow its snowing outside  bokuto turned his head to catch another look out the window surely enough snow was falling and in chunks too but this did not grasp bokutos attention frankly speaking it had no affect on him in the slightest he managed a feeble shrug and turned to continue on with the movie that hed watched for the thirtieth time already  akaashi was genuinely confused  i thought you were waiting for the snow i thought it was what you wanted  his eyelids drooping and then snapping open again bokuto made a small sound  mnh i see it all the time  just then akaashis lips parted in realization bokutos hallucinations had become such a part of him that he thought the snow outside was just another mind trick he breathed in sharply  its not a hallucination bokuto its actually snowing   bokuto looked up to stare out the window again there was a longing in his eyes that akaashi couldnt stand to see with barely an ounce of strength left bokuto pulled himself up a tad to get a better look outside curiosity had sparked within him he wanted to know if it was real or not he hated how difficult it had become for him to tell apart the real things from the fake ones  ill show you akaashi stood from his seat and walked to the windowsill there he parted the glass slightly a gust of icy wind charged its way into the room in an instant draining the warmth from everything it touched  bokutos skin crawled goose bumps pimpling his porcelain surface he pulled the thick blanket over himself with much effort  swiftly akaashi closed the window having gathered just enough snow off the edge for him to show to bokuto he strode to him quickly cupping the already melting snow in his hands bokuto held out his own eager to see if it were true  see look akaashi placed the small white compressed lump of snow into bokutos palm this earned a gasp from him bokuto stared down at the white clump of melting ice and with one finger he pressed against it to watch it fall apart the tiny snowflakes deteriorated in the warmth of his palm leaving a small puddle behind  a gasp escaped bokuto his eyes widened as much as they could  akaashi  i know  take me outside  its freezing akaashi murmured the words and looked bokuto up and down he was nothing more than a blanket with a head you tremble when its seventy degrees in the room right now its about ten degrees outside  please akaashi  pressing his lips into a thin slab of a line akaashi shook his head once more he found it much too difficult to say no to bokuto but it had to be done  i cant  but why bokutos spirits fell his frown deep  that weather will only hurt you you need to be protected  ffrom what bokuto stared at akaashi his features having gone from disappointed to unaccepting  akaashi drew in a breath but found that he couldnt say anything he watched bokuto with a wary gaze unaware of what he was to say next  im already in death row i can barely speak i can barely walk i cant eat i cant sleep the llast thing you he clenched his jaw frustrated with himself and the words he spoke  you need to do is worry about me catching a cold  bokuto  c cold or nnot im still not going to last v very long so please let me have this  his eyes were glued to akaashis and akaashi found that he was unable to look away bokutos eyes said everything to him he translated all that his words could not  akaashi looked down and away from bokuto then back to the window   i think the window will be as far as we can go he said in a hushed voice  thats fine with me and just like that a smile found bokutos face again  akaashi sighed to himself frustrated with how easily hed given in to bokutos begging but as he thought of it he figured he couldnt be blamed for it he didnt want to be the one to say no to someone who had little to nothing left in his life  there was that and the fact that akaashi couldnt help but find bokutos smile endearing no matter how sickly he looked when he wore one  come on akaashi reached a hand out to help bokuto to his feet he urged him to keep the blanket around him but bokuto insisted that he leave it behind he held onto the iv stand with one hand and akaashis hand with his other as he hobbled over to the window bokutos hands were as cold as ice causing akaashis concern in him to grow even more but no matter how much he worried for him akaashi continued on their way to the window at a slow and steady pace until they finally made it  once there bokuto pulled his hand from akaashis and leaned it against the windowsill the air was bitter and cold and it hit bokuto like a slap to the face as another gust of wind forced its way into the hospital room this did not faze him however as bokuto only closed his eyes and inhaled deeply allowing the burn of the winter air to fill his lungs when he exhaled a puff of smoke left him bokuto stuck his head out of the window slightly and kept it there as the snowflakes fell all around him  dont do that akaashi pulled bokuto back inside he expected to hear a whine of resistance from him but instead received nothing bokuto only complied and stuck his entire arm out instead watching as each individual snowflake passed around his limb as if none wanted to touch him on occasion one or two would land on him and he would draw his hand in quickly to try and see if he could make out the small pattern on them he would study them for quite a while until they melted and left behind nothing more than a droplet on his arm after this he would repeat the same process paying little to no mind to the freezing cold that surrounded him  akaashi watched bokuto mesmerized by his actions he almost portrayed the behaviors of a child sticking to an activity and refusing to let it up repeating whatever he was up to without having anyone to tell him to stop akaashi furrowed his brow and looked outside away from bokuto that familiar feeling of dread was rising from deep within him something akaashi wanted to forget he placed one hand on the windowsill and squeezed his knuckles going white  they shared another moment of silence something that occurred more often than akaashi would have liked though bokutos speaking skills werent as good as they used to be he was still the more talkative one out of the two so whenever he went silent an unwelcomed feeling of discomfort found its home within akaashi he wanted to rid himself of this feeling rid himself of this silence so he searched his mind in haste for any word that came to mind he needed something  anything  to say to bokuto just so that he could liberate himself of the horrid feeling that threatened to overtake him  you know i never asked akaashi managed to say staring out into the distance why are you so fond of the snow bokuto  he waited for an answer but did not receive one unnerved he spoke up again  i mean in your state now its a bit cliched dont you think it was his attempt at brightening the mood or being funny as some called it but alas his words had fallen flat on the ground as he received another silent reply from bokuto akaashi frowned deeply he turned his head to get a clear look at bokutos face but instantly wished he hadnt  in his silence bokuto wept to himself fat tears rolling down his cheeks in numbers the hand that supported his weight against the windowsill trembled without pause and his other remained outside shaking in the cold dead of night several flakes had gathered on the outstretched limb but they were not quick to melt they settled there deeming bokuto one of them for the remainder of their frozen lives before they eventually melted or fell away  akaashi stared at bokuto opened his mouth to say something but found that he couldnt form even one simple word realizing this akaashi decided to take action instead and reach out to comfort him but not even this he could do his arms and legs were stiff as were his eyes all he could do was stare at the melancholic performance that played out before him  do something akaashi closed his mouth and swallowed   do something   anything     akaashis body didnt respond  he could only watch as those tears fell at a faster pace down onto his hospital gown and onto the floor the light that came from outside reflected off of bokutos teardrops lighting his face up in the most gentle of ways eventually bokuto drew back his hand and let it fall to his side he hung his head and tried to keep his crying controlled in the best way possible but this proved to be very difficult as sobs broke out of him causing his entire being to shake  after a moment of trying to gather himself bokuto choked out two simple words with quivering lips  why me  akaashi stared on as his mind searched for words he found some and said them without a second thought  because life is unfair  bokuto reached up a cold frail hand to wipe at the mess that was his face i wanted to do sso many things  i know akaashi balled his hand into a fist mentally scolding himself for the present lack of emotion in his voice  as bokuto backed away from the window akaashi was quick to close it locking the bitter night air out of the room for the remainder of the night he then reached out and took hold of bokutos arm to help him back to the bed  once theyd reached it bokuto resumed his usual position and wrapped the thick blanket around himself then turned away from akaashi he watched the window quietly paying no mind to his visitor or so akaashi thought in a matter of minutes just as akaashi had started to fidget bokuto spoke up  akaashi  yes his undivided attention was on bokuto  he hesitated for a moment but finally spoke up i dont want you to visit me anymore  akaashis eyes squinted to the words and he leaned forward in shock what  please dont visit me anymore  no akaashi stood from his seat  please  no its a little too late for that bokuto a shiver racked akaashi causing the hairs on the back of his neck to stand  akaashi please  no is my final answer he stalked over to the other side of the bed where he would be able to look at bokutos face once bokuto noticed this he turned his head and slowly rolled away akaashis eyes widened his emotions now falling victim to a strange mix of fear and fury  bokuto what is the meaning of this  bokuto didnt respond he remained in the same position and only moved his hand to wipe at his face again  answer me  sucking his teeth bokuto pulled the blanket up to just beneath his chin it took some time but he finally answered  i dont want you to grow any mmore attached to me ththan yyou already are  akaashi nearly scoffed what makes you think im attached to you i never said that i was  this time bokuto directed his attention to akaashi he wore a grimace upon his reddened face  shshut up akaashi he breathed in deeply frustrated with himself and the gradual growth of his speech impediment but continued on i know you hate hospitals dont come telling mme now that you have only been coming here every day because yyou wanted to  akaashi had nothing else to say he stared at bokuto with his lips parted as if he were going to speak but ended up speechless  i know that you care ev even if its just a little bit bokuto covered his mouth and coughed suddenly he found that speaking was taking much more energy than he thought still he continued to talk i dont know much about this disease partly because i was too afraid to read up on it but i know i dont have much time left his frustration slowly faded and all that was left behind upon his pale face was a look of defeat  one maybe two months at most if im lucky thats how long i know i have left  the air around akaashi thickened and suddenly he found it difficult to breathe  bokuto looked down and twisted his lips to the side i heard the doctors talking they dont know how to hheal me so from beneath the blanket akaashi could see bokutos shoulders rise and fall its just a slow downhill ride ffrom here and i ddont want you to see it all hhappen  bokuto lay there glasseyed his welled up tears glinting in the dim lighting of the room  i dont want you to watch me decay  small tears spilled out of bokutos eyes and rolled down his hauntingly placid features so i figured if you left now you wouldnt have to and it wouldnt hhurt so much  once again that crippling spell took hold of him and akaashi couldnt move nor could he speak all he could do was watch in muted anguish as bokuto finally accepted what had become of his short lived life akaashi realized that those smiles hed seen before were smiles of denial  forced grins that tried desperately to trick bokuto into thinking that everything would be fine but he couldnt keep it up forever not in the state that he was in bokuto had always been struggling to keep a positive front but inside he was falling apart all along  akaashi knew this now  in an attempt to move he tapped his fingers against his legs at an impatient pace he was trying everything he could to psych himself into doing at least something to let bokuto know that he was there for him  do something as if he were one of the living dead akaashi forced one leg forward then the next until he was touching the bed side he pushed his negative thoughts aside and sat himself down in bed right next to bokuto akaashi did not give him time to react to this as he moved closer still and when he was close enough he lowered his head to lean it on bokutos shoulder  akaashi squeezed his hands together to keep them from shaking uncontrollably  im not leaving koutarou his voice was hushed gentle and nothing you say will make me leave  bokuto kept silent not a word left him even as he reached a hand up to wipe at his face again he only sniffed on occasion and shifted in place but never did he say anything to oppose akaashis decision  he was glad  akaashi turned his head slightly his cheek gently resting on bokutos shoulder he took in a slow deep breath and closed his eyes and his eyebrows knit together for only a second his hands quivered as he dug his nails into his knuckles  bokuto no longer smelled like a hospital  bokuto smelled like home        the reflection of ending movie credits could be seen in akaashis eyes as they scrolled up along the screen of his laptop  sitting back he reached a hand out and paused the movie thatd been on screen  so how was it watching the movie for the thousandth time there was almost a hint of sarcasm in his voice  lying next to akaashi a ghostly pale bokuto smiled  good bokuto eased back and buried his head into his pillow he looked in akaashis direction it took a moment for bokuto to focus on him  pulling his laptop close akaashi smoothed his finger along the mouse pad he looked to the lower right corner of the screen january 19th 640pm  akaashi pulled a solemn face and closed the laptop he moved in his seat and sat straight against the head of the bed then looked down at bokuto  his tired eyes were on akaashi he was grinning  forcing a smile of his own akaashi tilted his head only slightly  what are you smiling at he reached a hand out and touched bokutos forehead he was cool to the touch  colder than most akaashi was quick to withdraw his hand but he managed it discretely  it took a moment for bokuto to respond but after some time he managed some words   thank you  dont worry about it a sheepish grin curled akaashis lips i know youre fond of that movie he looked down at bokuto as he said this and glanced away soon after something told him that those words werent meant for the movie but akaashi shoved this thought away  he twisted his body to reach for the box of pocky that sat on the counter he opened it and pulled one out  do you want one  bokuto nodded and stretched a wobbling arm out akaashi placed it in between his fingers and bokuto retracted his hand to hold the biscuit snack against himself he held it to his nose with some difficulty and breathed in the strawberry scent then let his arm fall he touched at it lightly twirled it shakily between his fingers and studied it but he never ate it  akaashi placed the box back onto the counter and huffed softly  you seem to have grown more attached to that pocky stick than me  bokuto looked up surprised and glanced back down at the snack in his hands it took time for akaashis words to reach him but when they finally did his face lit up as he broke out in laughter  it was the weakest sound akaashi had ever heard  ah ive finally said something funny akaashi chuckled with bokuto folding his arms in the process i told you i had my moments every so often  bokutos laughter died down and he closed his eyes  rarely  give me a break here akaashis chortling had been dragged out for a few seconds longer before he too quieted down  they remained speechless in each others company for several minutes before bokuto actually spoke up his voice sounding like nothing more than a mere whisper  keiji  akaashi looked at him  mhm  bokuto swallowed thickly and toyed with the pocky in his hand  ask mme w why i like cloud atlas so much  perplexed akaashi directed his full attention to bokuto  well alright koutarou why do you like cloud atlas so much he watched bokuto intently curious to know what his answer would be  looking up at akaashi with eager eyes as if hed been asked the question out of his own free will bokuto gladly answered  s so you know in the mmovie when th characters die in one life he kept his weary yellow eyes on akaashi waiting for him to nod once he did bokuto continued wwell i like it when ththey find each other again in another life  bokutos voice was soft measly and carried no force to it but as he spoke about his favorite scene akaashi could sense a powerful vibe coming from him one that wasnt there before  a hopeful one  it mmakes me feel like ill hhave another life one beyond this one one thats better wh where i can actually wake up to you and be with y you a smile played on his pale thin lips one where we can live nnormal lives instead of living this one  akaashi couldnt find any words to say at that moment he stared at bokuto and could only nod with whatever it was he thought he was agreeing with he felt as if all the air had been squeezed out of his body by the words that bokuto had spoken  of all the things that bokuto found most endearing of the movie akaashi never thought it would be that  managing a miserable smile akaashi roughly rubbed his palm with his thumb  you know i would like that very much he spoke gently in bokutos direction  me too bokutos eyes never left akaashi he stared at him intently and watched every move he made to the point where this had captured akaashis attention  why do you watch me like that his emerald eyes met golden ones  though the question was asked clearly bokuto didnt make a sound nor did he move he instead continued to stare in akaashis direction with hopeful eyes  after what felt like the longest ten seconds of his life a sudden shudder charged down akaashis spine causing goose bumps to rise on his flesh he held his breath then proceeded to ask again  koutarou why do you watch me like that it took every fiber of his being to keep his voice from trembling  it was then that bokutos eyes blinked in realization and slowly but surely he moved his lips to answer  just because he replied in what almost sounded like a surprised tone i didnt want you to leave sometimes when i blink you arent there anymore bokuto rubbed one of his eyes then the other and let his hand drop to his sides  akaashi tried to hide his frown his eyes looked down at bokutos hands they were thin and bony and he could see those smooth blue veins curling over the bones beneath his flesh  he reached a hand out and took bokutos hand in his own  bokutos automatic reaction to the warmth was to curl his fingers around akaashis grasp he looked at him and exhaled through his nose quietly  akaashi met his gaze then looked down  dont worry im still here  bokuto nodded feebly against his pillow  im still here too his voice was weaker than before if possible  akaashi nodded with him  yeah youre still here too  with what little strength he had left bokuto beamed  akaashi wished he could do the same        new message  from kuroo sent january 31st at 225 pm  hey are you there  akaashi  yes i am  kuroo  how are things  akaashi  things could be better things could be worse  kuroo  may i ask how bokuto is doing  akaashi  hes hanging on  kuroo  can he still walk or talk  akaashi  no he cant he lost the ability to walk a little more than a week ago his ability to speak left him soon after  kuroo  i see you really are straightforward arent you  akaashi  i dont know any other way to put it sorry  akaashi looked up from his phone after sending the message and turned his head to notice that bokuto was once again staring at him with acute interest  his eyes read whos that  stuffing his phone in his pocket akaashi shrugged  just kuroo he said the name with a lack of interest to try and soften the blow but akaashi knew that no matter how he approached it bokuto would frown when he heard the name  and he did  bokuto looked down at akaashis hand his eyes gave away just how much he missed his friend feeling an amount of guilt build up within his chest akaashi pulled out his phone just as quickly as hed hid it away  would you like for him to send a photo  bokuto looked back up and thought for a moment then nodded  playing off of this akaashi texted for kuroo to send an image of himself for bokuto to see it took quite some time for a message from kuroo to arrive but when it did akaashi realized that hed sent a video instead of what was initially asked for  akaashi leaned over in his seat to move himself closer to bokuto with one elbow on the bed he held his phone so that the both of them could see bokuto stared at the screen with interested eyes wondering what the content would consist of akaashi pressed play and a video of kuroo started to play  he sat at home in bed with a snug fitting shirt on and his hair an absolute mess  whats up guys ahhhh i know you didnt tell me to send a video but im not someone who follows rules he pulled a mock cool expression but this was cut short as someone else spoke up  from the background of the video a low voice could be heard  what did you just say that to yourself  no wow no im taking a video  kuroo panned the phone to his side and a blurred kenma came into focus on screen he sat crosslegged with a shirt on that was two sizes too big and a hat that looked as if it had been placed on his head without his consent his head was down and his fingers moved swiftly over the buttons on the gaming device that he held in his hands at one point he reached a hand up to grab the beanie off of his head and he aimlessly chucked it to the ground with force  say hi kenma  wait what i didnt hear what you said kenma looked up and was greeted with a front facing camera he quickly got up from the bed and walked off dont record me  at least say hi kuroo called  hi the disembodied voice came from off screen  and thats kenma for you kuroo groaned as he repositioned himself in bed and then he smiled but putting him aside i hope all is well um he scratched at his cheek just below his eye i miss you guys i miss you especially bokuto um hang in there alright akaashi dont give him a hard time or you and i are going to fucking fight  bokuto smiled wide to those words he would have laughed if he could  a grin ghosted across akaashis lips as well but it was quick to vanish  well i guess thats it for now i would have kenma say bye too but he turned his head to look around he left the room yeah he left the room so ill just say bye for him see you bokuto keep it cool and remember youre the best he held his hand up in a peace sign and the video ended with him on screen  akaashi sighed he thought the video had gone by too quickly but it had actually lasted a little under thirty seconds  for a guy whos name is kuroo he sure is a colorful one akaashi sat up and placed his phone on the counter  bokuto nodded and looked up at akaashi once again  you guys were best friends huh  bokuto nodded once more he struggled to raise a hand and slowly he twirled his index finger in circles at the side of his head  akaashi snorted softly and leaned back in his seat  is he crazy  the smile on bokutos lips grew just a little more signifying that hed answered yes to akaashis question  it was moments like these that made akaashi realize just how much of an innocent soul bokuto really was every now and then it would come to him that bokuto was only twenty years old and that fact would only weigh akaashi down even more than it usually did it hurt him to think that bokuto had barely even experienced the joys of a young adults life before that crippling disease had taken a hold of him it was frustrating it was infuriating and it was overall saddening but akaashi could not show any of this not in front of bokuto  so instead of putting on a sour expression akaashi only kept a neutral one like he always did it was his best and only way to hide his pain        several hours had passed since the message from kuroo and both bokuto and akaashi didnt do much  without a voice bokuto couldnt keep up a conversation as well as he used to no matter how hard he tried and even if he could speak he wouldnt have been able to talk for long considering the state he was in his movements were uncoordinated and slow and the only sounds he could manage were meek and most of the time inaudible at times bokuto would do nothing but lie there in bed twitching back awake whenever his body tried so desperately to fall into the sleeping state that it once knew when this would happen hed pull a frustrated expression for only a moment before his face grew too tired to hold it any longer  when bokuto was like this akaashi would normally look away to spare himself the sight of it all but on rare occasions there were times when hed have no choice but to watch bokuto fall apart at the hands of his illness and he hated it  for every time akaashi would witness this his mind would repeat one phrase whether he wanted to hear it or not   this is what a dying person looks like   looking down swiftly akaashis sights locked onto his hands he glared at them intensely with that same placid expression of his making this look all the more unnerving he wanted the thought to leave his mind he wanted nothing to do with it he forced those words away and replaced them with new ones ones that said hes not dying hes going to be fine  but as he thought of it as he narrowed down the true meanings of both phrases he ultimately could not decide which of the two were more horrifying  akaashi closed his eyes and heaved out a sigh feeling more and more hopeless with each passing second he feared he wouldnt be able to pull himself out of this state but then it occurred to him that he was not alone in this  he felt the gentlest of taps against his arm and he turned his head to meet eyes that were as concerned as they were exhausted akaashi sat up straight and composed himself  im fine he commented softly leaning back in his seat how are you feeling koutarou  bokuto blinked slowly this was his way of saying he was feeling alright not great but alright  akaashi pursed his lips and nodded once he found himself unable to say anything else figuring that bokuto wouldnt have anything to say either but he was wrong  again he felt the light tapping against his arm surprised akaashi gave bokuto his attention again  hm what is it he turned the chair so that he was now facing bokuto from the front  gazing up at akaashi bokuto frowned and tried to form some words but failed in the end he looked around and moved his fingers trying to make out a phone akaashi picked this up quickly and he pulled his phone out for bokuto to use he opened his notes application and held the device in front of bokuto it was then that he started to inaccurately press at words that he was trying to make out it took him some time to get down what he wanted to say but after several minutes he withdrew his hand  akaashi looked at his phone to read the sentence it read  if i knew those words i spoke a week ago would have been my last i would have chosen them more carefully  akaashi stared intensely at the screen then tore his gaze away and looked back to bokuto  you werent happy with those words  slowly bokuto nodded  well then if you had a second chance akaashi hesitated he almost didnt want to ask the question what would you have chosen to say  just as those words left akaashis mouth the clouds outside parted allowing the setting suns orange light to flood into the room it illuminated both bokuto and akaashi and they squinted at the same time despite this akaashi did not miss the look of slight nervousness that claimed bokutos features  he was now more curious than hed ever been before  um bokuto you dont have to say it now if you dont want to  bokuto shook his head  so you dont want to  he shook his head again stronger this time  ah you do want to say it now  this time a weak sound left bokutos throat through a closed mouth and he nodded  alright akaashi shifted in his seat now timid he glanced to the side how many words are there in what you want to say i mean  responding as slowly as ever bokuto raised one hand on that one hand three fingers stuck out  akaashi felt his heart sink to his stomach another shudder threatened to rattle him but he kept himself still as difficult as that was  three words thats all akaashi forced a smile they felt mandatory now thats interesting   please please dont say them    he reached his arm out and held his phone in front of bokuto for him to type   please dont type them i dont want to hear them i dont want to read them i dont want to know them   for what felt like an eternity bokuto typed the words on akaashis phone his hand wobbled so much that it was impossible to decipher which letters he was hitting akaashi was close to holding his breath before bokuto had finally drew his hand back he let it fall over his stomach and there it rested his golden eyes searched the room for akaashi when hed finally found him those shining eyes of his lit up just a little more than usual and with that glint came his smile it was small and measly but there  akaashi made sure to take a mental picture of this before he looked down and closed his eyes he gripped his phone in his hand and took in a deep breath filling his lungs with all the air that he could before he exhaled through his nostrils he turned his phone so that it was facing him opened his eyes and read the three words that would haunt him forever   or so he thought  akaashis eyes widened slightly and his eyebrows knit together in surprise what sat upon the screen was not what he thought it would be but rather a simple compliment  you are beautiful  freezing in his seat akaashi read the words ten times over before he finally looked up he could feel his heartbeat thumping hard against his chest as if it wanted to break free his eyes locked onto bokutos  you think that im beautiful he asked this in a tone of disbelief  mustering a weak nod bokutos lips curled at the sides just a bit more with this he raised a quivering hand and his index finger he was trying to tell akaashi something else  guessing quickly akaashi muttered one  bokuto kept his finger up then moved his hand to point it at himself he did not give akaashi time to voice his guess as he then moved his finger to point at his eye then finally at akaashi  weakly akaashi parted his lips he almost couldnt find his voice but when he did he tried his best to keep it from shaking  since the first day you saw me  to this bokutos arm fell and rested lightly on his stomach he did the only thing that he could and nodded again then closed his eyes and slightly turned his head away  akaashi watched curiously as bokutos lips quivered into a wide grin and as the light captured his features akaashi realized just how embarrassed bokuto actually was  his face glowed the quietest shade of red and he tried to hide it from akaashi it seemed that after finally hearing his pent up thoughts aloud they had frayed his nerves more than he thought they would  seeing this display unfold before him akaashi could barely think his heart beat a mile a minute he found it difficult to swallow and one of his legs bounced up and down rapidly he didnt know how to react didnt know what to do or say but as he searched for the right words to speak or the right thing to do akaashi found himself doing something he didnt expect of himself  a light hearted laugh bubbled out from deep within his chest and the sound filled the room as soon as it hit the air he laughed hard or at least as hard as he could his voice was gentle light on bokutos ears it caused him to open his eyes and look in akaashis direction astonished those honeyhued eyes took in all that they could of akaashis laughing face the way his lips curled at the corners the way his eyes squinted just enough so that only a glint of green could be seen bokuto captured it all and in no time he found himself laughing too  it was a quiet laugh it was so weak and feeble it could barely be heard but it was there and akaashi could hear it so that was enough for bokuto his face still wore the same shade of red but he no longer minded this he was happy where he was he was happy that hed admitted those words he was glad that akaashi found company in him  finding a breath between his laughter akaashi managed to speak  youre ridiculous he said lightheartedly his fingers trembling around his phone  bokuto gave him a look that could only be read as i am arent i  slowly akaashis laugh eased into a chuckle and as he sat there in his seat he looked down at bokuto with placid eyes a genuine expression made its home on akaashis features and a hand reached up to push through his raven locks  thank you koutarou he whispered softly his voice shaking in his throat he reached a hand out and found bokutos  bokuto tightened his grasp in that automatic way he always did he stared up at akaashi with that smile that never seemed to fade his eyes read  youre welcome keiji        february 2nd   what time is it   akaashi stirred in bed slightly and let out a weak grunt he didnt bother to check he didnt care  the sky was already black he figured it was already past five in the afternoon so he didnt care anymore he didnt care if it was seven at night or eight at night or twelve in the morning or if the worlds clock stopped moving altogether  all he cared about was the fact that bokuto was still with him next to him breathing alive  all he cared about was the fact that bokuto koutarou was still there  akaashi moved his head to the side and touched his forehead to bokutos neck  bokutos movements were late to this but he reacted nonetheless as he turned akaashis way to touch his chin to the top of his head the soft touch of akaashis hair against his chin comforted bokuto and pulled him into a relaxed state  akaashi liked it when this happened it would cause less spasms to grip bokutos body allowing him to unwind more than he usually could akaashi didnt know why he had this effect on him but he did and that was all that mattered to him  the day was exceptionally cold but akaashi was glad to know that the hospitals room provided enough heat to keep bokuto from freezing over but even so bokuto still suffered from trembling spells and they would come in small short bursts and last only several seconds before his body became too weak to keep it up  akaashi always made sure to hold bokuto close and squeeze him tight whenever this happened just to let him know that he was there for him that he wasnt another one of those illusions his mind would create akaashi would also murmur quiet things to him from time to time to keep up a small often one sided conversation hed usually ask yes or no questions ones that were easy for bokuto to answer with a nod or shake of the head but sometimes he wouldnt answer certain questions despite akaashi asking them twice  he wouldnt always get answers akaashi was aware of this but he would still ask him things at other times he would just tell him things that were on his mind  it was strange how the less bokuto asked the more akaashi found himself saying  relaxing his head against the crook of bokutos neck akaashi blinked wearily and stared off into the distance he focused on nothing something he remembered kenma doing his hand held onto one of bokutos very thin arms and his thumb would occasionally rub up and down to comfort him they shared the same navy blue knit blanket and huddled up beneath it keeping each other warm in the best way that they could as akaashi lay there quiet listening to bokutos strained breathing he opened his mouth to speak  koutarou  he spoke just loudly enough for bokuto to hear him he felt him move against his head in response so he continued he drew in a deep breath and blinked away the stinging in his eyes  i want you to know that i dont regret meeting you  bokuto didnt move much he just breathed now  i am very happy to have met you and to have gotten to know you  akaashi paused for a long moment and said nothing for a while but then he spoke up again  so thank you koutarou for talking to me me in the hall that day and asking me if i was alright because i wasnt then but i am now  slipping his head down to bokutos chest akaashi leaned against his frail frame akaashi listened to the quickened rate of bokutos still beating heart and knew that this was his response to his words  akaashi closed his eyes against him he found he had nothing more to say he instead allowed his actions to speak for him he pulled himself closer to bokuto and nudged his face into the warmth of his neck he could feel bokutos chin rubbing against the top of his head like it always did it never failed to comfort akaashi he breathed in that familiar scent that hed grown so attached to then exhaled quietly against bokutos prominent collar bone  akaashi could feel a weak ailing arm pull itself up to rest upon his shoulder to this he shifted in closer and allowed his body to relax his breathing evened out and in no time he could feel himself slipping slowly into the warm grasp of sleep unable to resist  in a daze akaashis last words were good night koutarou before he slipped off into a deep sleep  he dreamt of nothing in particular that night he suffered no nightmares nor did he see anything remotely close to a dream there was nothing there was only blackness        akaashi woke up to the feeling of sunlight against his face it was warm on him certainly something that one would find comforting but as he stirred in bed he was certain that something was off  he kept his eyes halflidded and his movements reserved clinging onto the false hope that bokuto wasnt moving because he didnt want to wake him but akaashi knew that this wasnt the case he just didnt want to accept it  stretching out a trembling arm akaashi took hold of bokutos hand he shut his eyes and squeezed his palm it was cold his hand trembled harder with each passing second as if the movement would cause bokuto to wake up akaashis face buried into the crook of his neck he nudged the bridge of his nose against the cool skin his lips brushed against his collarbone in desperate search of that familiar warmth both hands had clasped around bokutos own now quavering without pause he couldnt find his pulse  devastation weighed down on akaashi in that instant it was a surreal feeling one that he could never in one million years describe it squeezed him threatening to crush him from the inside out the pain seared itself into his soul hindering him rendering him speechless to a point where he no longer knew what words were  a sob wretched its way out from akaashis throat  he tried desperately to hold it in tried so hard to keep himself together but he knew he was too weak to pull such a bluff once the second sob had left him he felt himself spiraling there was no hiding it he was undone  his body jerked with each sob that was torn from him his frame curling to bring himself closer he held his face against the corpses neck just beneath the jawline breathing in all that was left of bokuto  he had so many things hed wanted to do with him so many things hed wanted to say but all of those things seemed to have fallen away once the moment had finally come akaashi wanted to scream but he couldnt find his voice not even a sentence could get past his suffering  he kept himself against bokuto and held onto him with what little strength he had left in him he didnt get up to alert the nurses or the doctors or anyone in the hospital he knew that once they found out they would take bokuto away from him  so he stayed in place holding onto bokuto taking in his company for one last time before hed never see him again        once akaashi had left the hospital he never looked back  he walked home that day with a balled up blanket in his arms a burgundy scarf around his neck and nothing more from the hospital he held them against his frame in the twenty degree weather and though many people gave him strange looks and watched him sideways none of this affected him in the slightest the cold was no longer a factor to akaashi he couldnt feel it his mind wouldnt allow him to  he made it home without so much as a hello to his parents who sat in the living room they asked him questions he answered blatantly they asked about the blanket and the scarf but they never asked about bokuto  akaashi was glad it was a good idea to have never told them about him after all  he ascended the steps to his room balled his  no  bokutos blanket up into a lump and dropped it onto his bed along with the scarf he reached into his pocket to fish out his phone and pushed call on one of his contacts he held it up to his ear and waited for the other line to pick up once it did akaashi was greeted with a hello  akaashi hesitated he swallowed thickly and looked out the window  hello kuroo its akaashi are you busy  kuroos voice was reserved and reluctant  no im not  if it isnt too much trouble may i come over  kuroo was quiet on the other end he already knew he inhaled audibly and akaashi could hear a scratching sound after a moment he finally spoke his voice was solemn  sure        akaashi sat at the edge of kuroos bed and he stared out the window without focus kuroo spoke to him and akaashi listened and often responded but most of the time he only sat there and continued to watch nothing  kuroo would have been concerned if not for finding out what had happened earlier that day he was much like akaashi sitting on the same side of the bed a good distance apart from his visitor those yellow eyes of his would often dart to the floor then to the ceiling around the room and back to the floor but he would never look at akaashi  he feared that if he did he wouldnt be able to keep his emotions at bay  how did he look kuroo asked with a hushed tone  it took akaashi a while to respond  when i woke up  yeah kuroo looked down  akaashi let out a halfassed grunt and continued to stare forward  pale sick dead  how did you find out that he wasnt there anymore  his entire body was relaxed his head rested on mine with the weight of someones whos unconscious  this time kuroo was the one to grunt the sound coming from deep within his chest he was slow to speak up again but did either way  are you going to his funeral  no  the answer came so much more quickly than kuroo thought it would it shocked him as akaashi continued  i refuse to go my last memory of bokuto will not be of him sharply dressed pale stiff and stuffed in a casket surrounded by a countless amount of people who did not care for him at all until the day they heard about his death my last memory of koutaro is already with me and it will die along with me  akaashis tone was monotonous but kuroo didnt fail to detect the venom that lined each word prior to his last sentence he understood where akaashi was coming from and didnt even think of holding his icy tone against him kuroo was just as bitter he too did not intend on showing up to any funeral hed be furious with everyone in there and he knew that the same pain burned within akaashi too  kuroo leaned forward and joined his hands together he stared at the wall and bounced one leg up and down as his emotions slowly started to reclaim him  you know um he looked down and rubbed his neck roughly leaving behind deep red marks bokuto he he really liked uh cared about you he talked about you all the time when he first met y  dont  kuroo froze with his hand clinging to his neck he slowly looked up to find that akaashi was staring back at him with vacant eyes void of all known emotion  dont kuroo just dont  he swallowed thick and turned his head to stare out the window again akaashi laced his fingers together and dug his nails into the backs of his hands he was redirecting the pain  sorry it was the last word kuroo murmured before he stared forward as well having nothing more to say  they shared each others company in silence for what felt like the length of five minutes and in that time akaashi never once looked to the side to catch a glimpse at kuroo it wasnt until he watched kuroos form double over in his peripheral that akaashi did glance in his direction and when he did he was greeted with a quietly sobbing kuroo his face having been buried in the palms of his hands though is was delayed akaashi moved on instinct and sat near kuroo he placed a hand on his broad back and rubbed gently hoping to comfort him and to be the stronger of the two but as each second passed akaashi could feel his own pain building up more and more within him he wished he could fight it but he knew there was no possible way for him to  it wasnt long before akaashi had leaned his head on kuroos shoulder as he too fell victim to the sorrow that slowly ate him alive        it had been three days since bokutos passing and surely enough sleep did not come to akaashi as easily as it used to in the span of those three days he had only acquired a little over four hours of sleep in total on the first night out of the three akaashi flat out refused to get any rest in fear of suffering another night terror but during the other two nights he surely did make the effort to try and lull himself to sleep but each time he did he either found himself stirring awake from a strange dream or lying wide awake in the middle of the night half expecting to receive a message from bokuto  at times akaashi would look through the conversations that hed shared with him hed scroll up up up until the first text then would scroll all the way down again waiting for the ellipse to appear on the lower left side of the screen but always hed receive nothing  that night was no different as akaashi repeated this action for the twentieth time that day his thumb scrolling up and down for minutes on end until he finally came to a stop when he had however instead of shutting his phone off and trying to force a few hours of sleep upon himself akaashi stared at the phone screen longingly and read the last messages that were sent between them  bokuto sent at 215 am december 20th  hey akaashiiiii are you awake  akaashi  yes i am what is it  bokuto  im excited for you to come over tomorrow  akaashi  i visit you every day though  bokuto  i know you never miss a day dont your parents ever ask why you come here so much  akaashi  they think im interning so they dont mind  bokuto  oh works for me 9 o w  akaashi  i would hope so it works for me as well ill be sure to bring my laptop when i visit we can watch cloud atlas again  bokuto  yes please thank you akaashi  december 20th at 345 am  you probably fell asleep sorry for always messaging you so late sleep well akaashi ill see you soon  akaashi frowned and felt that familiar pain pierce his chest he reread sleep well akaashi and inhaled with frailty  im trying  he couldnt bring himself to read over the last four words of the text again and ultimately shut off his phone he placed it on the counter near his bedside and buried himself into the blanket that he had so openly shared with bokuto akaashi inhaled deeply and closed his eyes his eyebrows knitting together as his brow creased it still smelled like him  akaashi relaxed himself against his mattress and closed his eyes a powerless yawn leaving him his head eased into his pillow and to his surprise within a matter of minutes he could feel himself slipping it felt strange not falling asleep against bokutos body but akaashi knew that he would have to get used to this form of sleeping by his lonesome once again he just hoped that the night wouldnt bring him any malevolent dreams all he wanted was to see bokuto again even if just for a second an exhausted breath left him and akaashi finally fell asleep  that night he dreamt of the first night bokuto had come over his home he dreamt of how bokuto had buried himself into the navy blue blanket to watch the movie that played on the laptop screen and how he held bokuto in his arms that night to aid him in his attempt to sleep he could still remember the small details like how bokutos starry shirt would slip off his shoulder every so often when he stirred in bed and how the feel of bokutos weight on him would take his breath away akaashi could still feel the sensation of his wild white and black hair brushing against his cheek whenever he moved and the warmth that came from him as he held him close it was all still there but there was something different about it all that puzzled akaashi  at one point in his dream akaashi looked out the window the night sky had suddenly become a pale blue and the warm orange glow of the sun slowly spread across the horizon he turned his head slowly to look at bokuto and watched him as he lay in his arms akaashi said his name and to this bokuto stirred awake he turned his head and met akaashis gaze with weary well rested eyes he stretched and stifled a yawn pushed a hand through the mess that was his hair and relaxed his head against akaashis shoulder  sunlight broke into the room cascading all along the walls and floor and casting shadows all around it lit bokutos face up just enough for akaashi to take in those healthy features that were staring back at him he felt his heart rate accelerate and his throat tightened as his vision blurred bokuto beamed at him with a smile that spoke a thousand words and his hand reached out to touch akaashis cheek akaashi felt his palm warm full caressing the round of his face he leaned into his touch and his vision began to fade his eyes welling with tears  bokuto leaned in and touched his forehead to akaashis he was only a blurred shape now but akaashi knew he was still there bokuto spoke his voice peaceful healthy whole  i found you  a trembling tender laugh escaped akaashi he smiled  you found me'"

       "'it had been some time since akaashi set foot into that hospitalit was a dreary place for him a place he was not fond of but a place he was obligated to visit akaashis parents were intent on having him intern in a hospital nearby so that he could stockpile more things that would look good on his resume for future purposesoften times however akaashi would disagree with his parents unhappy with the suggestions theyd given him but ultimately they would urge him to carry out the task that had been pushed on him and one way or another hed do itasking around here and there the male put little to no effort in finding out where he could go to sign up for what he didnt care nor did he think he would care in the near future akaashi was unhappy with where he was unhappy with what it was that he was doing he was wasting time asking for something that he did not want in the leastpointing a finger down the hall a small assistant nurse directed akaashi to a different desk one where he would be able to find more information on the subject blatantly he thanked her and continued on his way passing by several rooms as he did sohis eyes where set forward he didnt look into any of the rooms he didnt want to it would hurt if he didakaashi closed his eyes and sighed swaying absentmindedly in his step opening his eyes just in time to swiftly avoid colliding with someonea doctor no just another personhe circled around the male apologizing flatly before he continued on an its alright could be heard from behind him but it soon faded as akaashi continued forwarddo i really want to do thishis eyes stared forward uninterested in the information desk several meters from himno i really dontstanding still akaashi remained in place for quite some time his legs refusing to carry him further people walked by him around him up and down the halls to and fro but no one seemed to notice him he stood there hesitant uninterested indifferentunfeelinghe remained in place silently no one was bothered by him so there he stood he brought a hand up to push through his black hair and slowly his head fell forward akaashi stared at his shoeswhat am i doingthe thought rattled his mindwhy am i even hereanother person walked by at a gradual pace at first then slowed progressively as they drew near their walking then slowed to a halt and it was then that akaashi had become aware of the new individual whod invaded his personal spacefrom his peripheral akaashi could see their hand reaching out to himhe withdrew and looked upoh you can move he smiled in akaashis direction bright yellow eyes catching his own it had been the same guy hed almost bumped into perhaps hed remained in the hall and watched as akaashi had gone from a brisk walk to a sudden stop he understood how that would be alarming to some peopleis there something wrong with me standing here akaashi asked sincerelyno i dont think so he brought his hand down to his side why did you stop so suddenly are you alrightim fine i was just thinking akaashi blinked slowlyof whata question asker how thrilling of this hospital ive realized that i dont want to come here anymorethe male who stood across from akaashi shifted his weight to one leg were you sick are you checking outakaashi stared through the stranger no im not sick but this place makes me feel like i am his answer was cold but it did not seem to cut through the others pleasant moodi feel the same about this place honestly he paused so you must be leaving soon thenyeah akaashi shifted leaning in the direction of where hed come fromhe had no interest in staying where he was his only intention was leaving he figured he would tell his parents that the people in the hospital were too occupied with everything else to tend to him he started on his way without so much as a second glance in the others direction goodbyehey heyakaashi turned his head whatwhats your namewhy did he want to know his name when would he ever use it again the stranger could have been a patient at the hospital for all akaashi knew and the last thing he needed was a sickly acquaintance to add to his already short list of friendsyou dont need to knowthe male across from him did well in hiding the look of offense that almost surfaced upon his face i understand but for what its worth my name is bokutoakaashi cast a weary look in bokutos direction gave a nod and continued on his way until he was out of the building  two weeks had passed since akaashis last visit and to his dismay he found himself on the same aimless path back to the same dreaded hospital he couldnt stand his parents persistent natures but he was somewhat relieved to be out of the house to say the leasthere we go againakaashi entered the building and greeted the woman at the front desk as always he wasted no time ascending the steps needed to get to the part of the hospital where hed almost reached all that time ago in minutes the information desk was in his sights and for the first time in forever hed actually gone to ithe spoke with a small woman there and after several minutes had passed akaashi backed away from the desk some sheets of paper in hand he started down the hall sighing heavily intent on rushing homehey hey its youthe familiar voice made akaashis throat tighten another sigh was forced out even heavier this time he turned aroundbokutoapathykun he grinned from ear to eardont call me that akaashi stuffed the sheets into his bagi thought you said you werent ever going to set foot in here again there was something strange about the excitement in his tonei didnt say exactly thatbut it was impliedakaashi squintedyes it was impliedbokutos smile never left his face and his tired eyelids contradicted his facial expressionwhy must i always run into the strange ones so what brings you here againi could ask you the same thing akaashis lips screwed to the sidethick white eyebrows raised above yellow hues im supposed to be here actuallyakaashi yawned internno patient his smile was unnervingsilently the dark haired male frowned ive been insensitivea laugh bubbled out from bokuto no you havent dont worry about itthough hed been dressed in normal casual clothing upon further examination there was indeed something sickly about him he was paler than the others who walked along in the halls and soft dark circles sat under his eyesakaashi made sure not to starei know you arent going to ask so ill just let you know from what ive heard the doctors say that whatever i have is called ffi bokuto folded his arms he held an air around him as if he were having a normal conversation about the weather fatal familial insomnia if i remember correctlya cold shiver curled up akaashis spine hed never heard of that disease before it worried him enough to get some words out of himi dont think i want to ask about the symptoms of this illnesswell even if you wanted to i wouldnt have an answer for you another laugh all i can say is that sleeping doesnt come as easily as it used to what normally would have pained someone to say he delivered with ease and with that same grin to bootakaashi couldnt help but almost smile back his lips barely twitching he stared in bokutos direction at him this time are you here every dayof course been here for about four weeks now he blinked sluggishlyi see akaashi nodded once no words were exchanged for a moment and soon the short amount of silence had become awkward well ill be going nowshut him out dont let him in hes sick ahuh one secondakaashis jaw clenched i have to go bokuto he started on his wayplease dont persistif you would please listen his hands at his sides bokuto bowed please it will only take a secondakaashi was straightforward but he wasnt heartless he huffed out a breath and turned around what is it i really have to gohis eyes lighting up bokuto straightened his back and fished his hand into his pocket he pulled out a phone and to akaashis dread he asked for his phone numberwhat was he to do what was he to say akaashi literally found nothing special about bokuto why had the sickly one taken a sudden liking to him he wanted nothing more than to push him away throw away the forms and never set foot into that hospital again but for some strange and irritating reason akaashi found it difficult to deny bokuto he was trying to he truly was but he just couldnti dont usually text akaashi murmured he looked down at bokutos phone he couldnt look at his face im often busy keeping in contact with me wouldnt be a good ideahe watched bokutos fingers curl around the phone and his hand slowly backed awaybut akaashi shocked himself with that one word he could still see bokutos hand and it had frozen in place i guess i could find some time to talk every so often he looked up and his gaze found bokutos those yellow eyes were gleaminghe entered his number swiftly and then handed the phone to bokuto the name section emptythank you his voice was full of excitement as he proceeded to enter the name for his new contact akaashi watched closely as bokuto mouthed and typed the nameapathykun bokuto was close to saving the contact before akaashi spoke upyou dont have to put that he sighed its akaashi  the sky burned a strong orange glow as the sun set in the distance akaashi sat in bed laptop in his lap as his fingers scrolled and typed franticallyffi the page loaded akaashi went straight into the readingffi is a very rare autosomal dominant inherited prion disease of the brain akaashis eyes scanned the screen ffi has no known cure and involves progressively worsening insomnia which leads to hallucinations delirium and confusional states like that of dementiathin lips pressed into an even thinner line his fingers remained stiff for quite some time as his eyes read the introductory paragraph over and over againthere is no known cure huh akaashi continued to read on all the people whove contracted this disease eventually die within a year or less this part was read aloudhe rubbed his face quietly of course they do akaashi leaned his head on his hand chin resting in his palmi wonder if bokuto knows about all of this he must have looked it up at some point right it was the only normal thing to do considering how he was the one who was suffering from said diseaseinsomnia he thought back to the bags around bokutos eyesall i can say is that sleeping doesnt come as easily as it used to akaashi exhaled quickly through his nose making a sound that was almost like a laugh he read up on the symptoms and blinked gently a hand over his lips after several minutes akaashi closed his laptop and lay back on his bed he stared at the ceilingsome friend ive madethere wasnt much else to say  new text messagefrom bokuto sent july 29th at 1156 pmhey i hope this isnt a bad timeakaashi lifted his head from his pillow and reached a hand out to grab his phone the bright light caused him to squint as he read the message quietly he contemplated on whether he wanted to respond or not he blinked weakly and slid his fingers down the sides of his phone a sign of weariness that he could not disobey akaashi watched as the screen went to black and it was then that he placed the phone back on his nightstand choosing to ignore the messagehe couldnt sleep for about an hour after the text but ultimately slipped off to sleepakaashi never received another message in the remaining hour that he was awake  during the next day akaashi decided to stay home he sat in his room for the majority of the day and had spent at least six hours awake until hed picked his phone up in his hands againhe looked at the message bokuto had sent him the night before his thumb aimlessly hovered over the keyboard thinking of what to typefrom akaashi sent at 443pmhellobokutohey hey heyyyyyi must have texted you while you were asleepakaashi was dumbfounded hed never received a faster response in his lifeakaashiyeah that mustve been the caseyou say hey a lot bokutobokutoi know its kind of my thingakaashi could feel bokutos enthusiasm through his text messages he spoke to akaashi as if he hadnt had a friend to text in yearsbokutohow are you todayakaashiim well thank you just catching up on some volleyball thingsbokutovolleyball you like volleyball too we have to play togetherwincing a bit akaashi squinted at his phone screen such an energetic texter bokuto was he was kind of difficult to keep up with and akaashi felt like this would be a long term sort of thingakaashiuh sure i mean will they let you out of the hospitalbokutoi guess i can still walk around and get to where i have to go pretty much the only thing wrong with me is that i cant sleepakaashi scowled he could feel the ignorance emanating off of bokutos text messages did he really think he was admitted to a hospital just because he was having trouble sleeping he knew full well the name of the disease he had so then why was he so cheerful about his entire situation why did he lack the understanding of just how serious his condition wasunless bokuto was purposely playing the fool he must have beenright akaashis grip tightened around his phone he had to beakaashithen i guess ill see you at the hospital around a week or two from now i know a gymnasium we can go tobokutoa week or twoakaashiis that too long a wait i can probably reschedulebokutonah its alright i guess i can wait that long ive got timeive got time the words echoed in akaashis head as if theyd been spoken aloud he stared down at the screen his brow furrowing slightly did bokuto know about the lifespan of victims with his condition was he just playing the fool after all just what kind of guy was heindifference morphed into curiosity and said curiosity was what drew akaashi closer to his new friendakaashigreat ill see you then  akaashianother two weeks had passed since akaashi had seen bokuto but this time he waited outside of the hospital several meters away from the entranceakaashi had looked up from his phone and stuffed it into his jacket pocket as the energetic hospital patient made his way across the lot in no time bokuto was standing in front of akaashi eager in every way to make it to the gymnasiumi havent set foot outside in weeks he looked around the day was strangely chilly with an occasional breeze now and then causing the browning leaves to rustle in the trees above those yellow eyes examined everything adamant with taking all of it inbokuto tucked his hands into the pockets of his hood his shoulders hunching a puff of smoke came from him as he exhaled he was paler than before and the bags under his eyes were darker bokuto looked exhausted beyond belief yet there he stood excited to make his way to the gymnasiumakaashi hadnt even mustered his first word before bokuto snapped his head to the side to give him his undivided attentionthe gymnasiums about ten minutes that way akaashi pointed down the roadthen lets go bokuto power walked ahead obligating akaashi to catch up to him with a quickened pace whether he wanted to or not  the sounds of their sneakers squeaking against the gym floor was so memory inducing it caused akaashi to take a moment and reminisce on the old days as if doing so would take him back in time to when hed play volleyball every single day after school after a while he opened his eyes and sighed then moved across the court to the net hed brought along a volleyball of his own just in case they werent provided with anywhat used to be your position back when you would play bokuto asked aloud finally pulling his hands from his hood pockets his head was cocked back as he surveyed the gymakaashi bounced the ball off the floor twice setter youbokuto grinned i was the team captain and the ace he gave a mock swing of his arm as if spiking do you think you can toss to meof courseakaashi and bokuto carried a sort of unspoken communication with each other they had a strange relationship to say the least akaashi would answer his questions coldly with little to no emotion but bokuto would cherish these answers and retort with excitement in his tone he did not seem to take offense easily bokuto was very different from everyone else akaashi had ever met before himwhere most people would detach themselves bokuto took hold and wouldnt let go being as persistent as he was energetic it was very unsettling akaashi turned away and frownedi wouldnt have given you my number if you werent a patient the black haired male bounced the ball again and walked over to positionthis is all so nostalgic bokutos voice was filled to the brim with excitement he took several steps back to prepare himself for the toss mentally he was more than ready to spike but not so much physicallybokuto missed akaashis set twelve timesshit shit his frustration was unmasked please toss to me again he threw the ball to akaashitheres no stopping you is there taking the ball in his hands akaashi aimed for the approximate location as to where bokuto would spike the ball he wanted for him to spike it at least once lest bokuto threw a self hateinduced panic attackwatching as bokuto ran forward akaashi set the ball perfectly it brought him back to his high school days now if only the sickly one would hit itthe sound of the palm of bokutos hand meeting the ball sounded much like an explosion akaashi flinched it had been so long since hed heard something so loud it was amazingha did you see that bokuto was bursting with emotion he was ecstatic i spiked it perfectly just now that toss was perfect without hesitation he ran across the court to retrieve the ballakaashi knew that running probably wasnt the best thing that he should have been doing but he said nothing about it the ball was tossed back to him and again he got back to tossing the ball for bokutoafter three sets there was another hit and another cheer from the former ace akaashi raised his eyebrowsimpressive he watched the ball roll further away from them and expected to see bokuto trailing it but instead saw nothing he turned his attention back to the only other in the roombokuto stared off in the distance from beyond the net his face carrying a confused expression after a moment quietly he spokethey arent really there are they the words left his mouth reluctantlyakaashi glanced in the direction of where bokuto was staring no one they were the only two in the gym he dug his thumb nail into the side of his index finger and returned his gaze to bokutothey arent really there he had to force himself to say the mere four wordsbokuto mouthed an okay before backing up several steps could you please toss to me some moresure akaashi nodded once and that was all that bokuto needed to hear before he ran off to retrieve the ball  at some point during their walk home from the gym akaashi had agreed for bokuto to spend the night at his housemy parents are out for a month hed unconsciously said causing bokuto to go into a begging frenzy to stay over until akaashi said yes normally he would have been red with irritation from the sound of such irksome persistence but the smile that would claim bokutos face whenever he agreed to something would make akaashi forget all about how frustrated he washe entered his home with bokuto in a matter of minutes having walked faster than usual out there the sickly one trembled like a new born animal even with the extra jacket that akaashi had offered himits warm bokuto exhaled and shuddered once he was inside slipping off his shoesakaashi stepped in and turned his head i would hope so he moved forward my room is this waybokuto followed briskly he observed his surroundings once again having been fascinated by the inside of someone elses home everything was neat and placed perfectly here and there giving akaashis house a warm atmosphere to it it reminded him of his homebokuto nearly bumped into akaashi as he stopped to enter his roomyou can sit anywhere he climbed into bed and folded one leg pulling over his laptop to start it upis your bed alright bokuto pulled off akaashis jacketi said anywherebokuto plopped onto the mattress right after those words bumping his head against akaashis shoulder he recoiled with a gruntwatch it akaashi shifted to the side to give his visitor more room despite this bokuto was still close enough for their arms to touch akaashi sighed and lazily dragged his finger along the dpad do you want to watch a moviebokuto curled in on himself and pushed his hands into his hood pocket yeah anything is fine his yellow eyes stared at the screen intentlyokay akaashi opened the first movie that he had in his computers memory he pushed the laptop away and pressed playwhats it called confused bokuto glanced over at himcloud atlashow long is itabout three hours he kicked his legs out of bed and walked across his room to retrieve a thick blanket that sat bundled up in a rolling chair he then tossed it to bokuto once he was close enough youve been shivering use itbokuto gathered the navy blue blanket in his arms and cautiously threw it around his shoulders it was soft thank you he kept his eyes on the screen i used to handle the cold better than this an embarrassed chuckle escaped himexhaling through his nostrils akaashi reclaimed his seat in bed crossing his legs things happenyeahoutside the sky above grew dark as clouds rolled in bokuto quieted himself curled up and watched on as the movie started  the sound of rain pelting hard against the window snapped akaashi back into reality he looked around in weary haste but calmed quickly once his memory had returned to him hed nodded off for a brief moment with his arms crossed and his head resting on a thick bundle of pillows with much effort he sat up to look at bokutothe movie was well over two hours in nearing its end and bokuto lay on his side curled up and clutching the blanket with what little strength he had left his eyes were halflidded and glued to the screen his face void of emotion it almost looked as if he were asleepbokuto akaashis voice was groggyslowly his yellow eyes scrolled to the side to catch akaashis gaze he turned his head weakly and his body along with itim sorry ive watched this movie so many times i actually fell asleep akaashi dragged a hand down his facedont be sorry bokuto found himself smiling its your house you sleep if you want tonot if i have a visitor overits fine im not just some visitor after all were friends bokutos head lolled to the side directing his attention back to the movie you were out for about an hourakaashi heaved a sigh he rubbed the back of his necki envy you i wish i could sleep like that againguilt bubbled up within akaashis chest hed realized just how rude that was falling asleep so easily in front of a person whos biggest struggle was just thathow insensitive of me he furrowed his brow mentally scolding himselfdont cry over it bokuto shifted as he lay down sticking a leg out to kick akaashi the movie kept me company its very good kind of confusing but good ill have to watch it againstrange bokuto was such a strange one he seemed to be unfazed by many things and blatant about others blurting sentences out that didnt seem to have much thought behind them akaashi doubted that hed ever have bokuto over again so hearing him say ill have to watch it again didnt sit too well with himakaashi twisted his lips to the side and decided to bring up something else are you tiredexhausted bokuto answered honestlyclose your eyes for the time being akaashi kicked his legs out of bed with much effort and stood on his feet ill get us some water he left the room quickly leaving bokuto by his lonesomeafter several seconds hed returned to see that bokuto had changed his position in bed entirely he lay on his back with his head on some of akaashis pillows his hands rested on his stomach the dark blanket surrounding him from behind but slipping off just enough for his torso to be exposed his head rested against the bed slumped to the side facing away from akaashiagain if he hadnt known any better akaashi would have figured that bokuto was already fast asleep he approached his bedside silently the room was dark apart from the soft orange glow that his lamp gave offhe set the drinks down and shuffled into bed as if trying not to wake the other lying on his back he stared at the ceilingno words were exchanged for what seemed like forever before akaashi spoke uphow does it feel to not be able to sleepbokutos answer was delayed awful he turned his head in the opposite direction facing akaashi now i can barely keep my eyes open by day and can barely keep them closed by night he snorted in laughterdoes it frustrate youit did at first when i didnt understand why but now im kind of okay with it a hand reached up to push through his own messy locks i still miss it though sleeping dreamingakaashi watched bokuto listening to every word he saidi used to have some insane dreams too especially before certain volleyball matches he laughed again louder this time id dream that i messed up during a spike and then id wake up fuming and would constantly tell myself that i was the bestdo you still think that you are the best emerald eyes searched bokutos own for an honest answerhe sighed his response with a grin yeah bokuto closed his eyes after that one hand resting on the side of his head he was obviously tired showing signs of exhaustion with every small move he madeakaashi grew silent and knitted his fingers together on his stomach his head relaxing into his pillow the both of them didnt exchange any words after that ending the conversation just as suddenly as it had started  two hours had passed since their last words towards each other yet akaashi still lay awake in bed unknown to bokuto he watched him quietly through almost closed eyelids his thick lashes being enough to hide the fact that he was still awake tired but awakeakaashi couldnt sleep but it wasnt because of his unfamiliarity with bokuto that caused this he couldnt sleep because of his honest fascination with himbokuto would lay still for quite a while his head tilted to the side with one hand on his stomach and the other at his side when he was like this akaashi would think that he was resting and he would almost believe that thought until bokuto would twitch awake again his body jerking him from what little relaxation he tried to achieveat first akaashi thought nothing of it bokuto would wince and snap back to reality the way someone would when they dreamt they were falling but akaashi knew full well that such a thing wasnt possible with bokutos condition it made akaashi pity him to say the leastthree times bokuto jolted awake involuntarily and three times he covered his eyes with his forearm and heaved a quiet sigh akaashi refused to have reacted to those moments hoping to spare his visitor the embarrassment of him having seen that he intended on closing his eyes and falling asleep for real afterwards but after having felt his mattress shake for the fourth time he opened his eyesakaashi lifted himself onto his elbows bokuto he whisperedalarmed he snapped around quickly his face looked both shocked and exhausted at the same time akaashi imdont his voice a mere murmur akaashi moved closer to bokuto then resumed to lie down on his back his head slightly elevated with the pillows that sat behind him dont apologizemildly embarrassed bokuto looked away and rubbed his armscome akaashi beckoned for his visitorturning his attention back to him bokuto met akaashis gaze he wore a confused expression wondering just what the other had meant by that wordi said come he motioned for bokuto to come closer get over here as akaashi said this he held out an arm as if readying himself for some sort of hugobeying with hesitance bokuto shifted towards akaashi and lay against him fitting into the curve of his arm it was no doubt that he was larger than akaashi but that didnt stop him from fitting in just rightbokutos head lay against akaashis shoulder akaashis arm cautiously wrapped itself around bokutos broad shouldersneither of them said a wordminutes passed and in time akaashi could feel bokuto relaxing against him the signs of fatigue finally wearing him down his head slumped against his shoulder and both his hands rested on his stomach he was trying trying so hard to fit in that small amount of sleep that would get him through the next day and akaashi wanted to helpas much as he didnt want to believe it akaashi wanted so badly to helpwhy akaashi watched as one of bokutos hands twitched involuntarily and to his dismay it wouldnt stop slowly he reached a hand out and closed it over the twitching one his four fingers fitting into bokutos palm in seconds his hand was calm againakaashi inhaled quietly he watched as bokutos chest rose and fell with each breath that kept him alive his breathing was controlled much like one of a persons who was actually asleep pursing his lips akaashi let his head fall back into the pillows he turned his head to the side towards bokutos he could smell his faint scent he smelled sort of like a hospital   akaashi made his way to the hospital for the umpteenth time that week his hands in his jacket pockets and his nose burying into the burgundy knit scarf that protected him from the chilly weatherit had been two months since bokutos visit over his home and ever since then akaashi found that making his way to the hospital had become a daily routine for him and even if he didnt show up he would still spend his days sending messages to bokuto be it text email or the occasional video chathe exhaled through his nose and entered the hospital greeted the woman at the front desk who now knew him by name and removed the scarf from around his neck akaashi already knew where he had to gohe ascended those familiar steps said hello to the familiar faces and rounded that familiar corner that he knew would lead him to bokutos room another breath escaped him slow and casual but hed soon learned to hold his breath when he noticed another person sitting outside in the hall several feet from the room where visitors could spend their timeakaashi eyeballed the small male for a long second knowing that he wouldnt look up to catch him his head hung low and his attention belonged only to the handheld system that entertained himnormally akaashi would have walked away that instant in order to pay bokuto a visit but as he neared his room he could hear two voices coming from within one of the voices belonged to bokuto the other he had no clue akaashi paused and gripped the strap of his bag hesitating he turned pivoting on one foot to stare back at the small one who sat by his lonesome feeling that it would be rude to interrupt bokutos conversation with whoever the other person was akaashi strode over to the seats and sat one chair away from the gaming strangerakaashi tapped his fingers quietly against his pants are you here to see bokuto koutarou akaashis asked in a leveled toneno my friend is the other spoke in a quiet voice low and brooding or maybe not brooding but more along the lines of apatheticapathykun the nickname popped into akaashis head for a brief second he wasnt too sure whyis your friend a friend of bokutosyeah an old friend he pressed pause on his psp and tapped one end of it against his open palm they used to play volleyball together they go back a couple of yearsakaashi leaned back in his seat ah i see he felt the need to keep most of his questions at bay his company did not seem like the type to socialize so openly so he figured simple inquiries would do just fine especially if he kept them to a minimummay i ask your name akaashi took a shot at ita small thumb rubbed at the systems screen to remove a smudge he looked up gazed at akaashi past his bleached blonde bangs and straightened his back in the slightest way possiblekozume kenmaakaashi keiji he felt like he could enjoy kozumes company what with how his words lacked all form of emotion its nice to meet you kozumekenma is fine he looked back down at the game screen likewiseakaashi nodded glad to have made an acquaintance and would have relaxed into his seat if not for the sudden disembodied voice that startled him soon after kenmas sentencehey kenma who are you talking to as if straight from a cartoon out popped a tall male from bokutos room with stark black hair that both hung over his face and stuck out in all directions he carried a look on his face that made him seem more sinister than sincere and his eyes flitted from kenma to akaashi and then back to kenmathis is akaashi i just met him his words were as straightforward as they were indifferentakaashi bokutos voice rang out from the room this time akaashi didnt even have to see his face to know that bokuto was beaming hes here is he herei am akaashi rose from his seat to enter the room but instead found bokuto standing at the door in seconds his eyes wide with surprise he was thinner than before a large flannel shirt fitting him loosely he had probably lost a bit overtwenty pounds in the two months that passedakaashi frowned get back into bed you shouldnt bebokuto didnt allow him to finish his sentence as he embraced akaashi suddenly i didnt think you were going to make it today though hed gotten thinner his arms still had some power to them he squeezed akaashi mashing him closer until he could barely breatheakaashis eyebrows knit together i told you i would he all but murmured against bokutos shoulderwhats this the taller dark haired male gestured to them i come to visit and im barely paid attention to but when he comes along hes given the whole packagebokuto pulled away to face his smirking friend relax he then turned his attention to akaashi this is kuroo a close friend of minehe cocked his head to the side nice to meet you akaashi ive heard a lot about you in the short hour that ive been herenodding once akaashi acknowledged kuroos words but did not know how to respond to them all he had to offer was a the pleasure is mine before moving forward to try and usher bokuto back into his roomhey hey bokuto resisted standing firm in place we were actually just talking about stepping outsidewell i brought it up just as a suggestion but then he got really excited kuroo scratched the back of his head so we were going to step outside for a minute or two in order to get this owl to shut upive been cooped up in this place for too long i havent gone outside in days the discomfort could be heard in bokutos voice if there was one thing that akaashi had learned about bokuto in the little time that hed known him it was that he wasnt too fond of staying locked up indoors maybe taking him outside for a while would do him some goodakaashi looked down the hall lets go then to the garden out in the backeveryone came to an unspoken agreement after the one sentence kuroo started down the hall bokuto trailing after him akaashi followed after knowing that kenma was nearby as he walked he stared at the backs of the two men in front of him they both seemed to be the same height but akaashi couldnt help but realize that bokuto looked just a bit smaller  a mere two minutes outside had turned into two hoursakaashi shared a bench with kenma the both of them had sat down long ago leaving bokuto and kuroo to their own business as they wandered about and waved their arms around in their animated way of speaking he found it strange how bokuto was the one walking around when he was the sick one out of the lot he furrowed his brow and exhaled heavily his eyes looking down he stared at his knees intensely before kenma spoke upyou dont like to see him like that do youakaashi lifted his head and looked to his side he eyed the blonde one for quite a while kenma didnt give him a chance to respondi dont like to see him like that either its why i didnt want to come along but kuroo insisted kenmas unconcerned tone contradicted his words but something told akaashi that he meant everything he was sayingwere you ever friends with bokuto akaashi lifted his head in subtle interestmore like acquaintances our teams would face each other often whenever we did kuroo and bokuto would meet up afterwards and spend time together im usually around kuroo so he shrugged with little energy i sort of got to know him through kuroos company hes an okay guy loud thoughbokutos disembodied laughter rang throughout the garden as if to prove kenma rightakaashi almost smiled so how are you taking all of this if i may askim kenmas lips puckered in thought im taking it well or at least i think i am im trying to detach myself its another reason why i didnt want to pay bokuto any visits he looked down his hair hanging over his face theres something about bokuto that doesnt sit well with meconfused and mildly shocked akaashi made a face is there something wrong with him has he ever done anything badnot to my knowledge but even if he has thats not what i meant kenma rubbed his nose with his sleeve it doesnt matter if youve never met bokuto before or if you havent seen him in ten days or ten weeks or ten months or ten years if you ever interact with him in even the slightest youll be reminded of just how good a person he really isakaashi stared at kenma speechlesshes genuine kind and at times infantile but thats what makes him so likeable i suppose he drags you back in he praises others while shouting that hes the best at everything he does its ridiculouslooking away slowly akaashi watched as bokuto and kuroo reappeared in the distance they were still wrapped up in whatever conversation they were havingkuroo looks happy now but he wasnt then kenma almost murmured the words akaashi turned to catch a glimpse of him but he stared off in the distance his eyes not focusing on anything in particular blinking akaashi turned his attention back to kuroo and bokutofive weeks ago he was in shambles he didnt want to talk to anyone he only accepted my company i was the only one willing to give it to him he continued to stare on as he talked that was when he learned about the disease this entire past month hasnt been any different for him though he almost didnt want to come today either no one likes to find out that someone they care about is sick much less diagnosed with a disease that cant be curedbokuto and kuroo continued to talk animatedly the both of them out of earshotbokuto is starting to look less and less like his old self too he used to be thicker he used to be bigger than kuroo but now hes the one whos smaller kuroos the bigger one kuroos the heavier one it doesnt it doesnt make any sensepursing his lips into a thin line akaashi looked down and noticed that kenma had laced his fingers together he pulled and tugged at them restlessly his hands showed what his face dared notakaashi figured it was safe to say that bokuto had already begun to pull kenma back in it was an awful thing to do but akaashi knew full well that none of it was intentional on bokutos part all he had to do was talk to someone and in an instant they would be involved in bokutos lively shenanigans once againakaashi knew this the same thing happened to him some two and a half months ago if he had known that sending simple text messages would have turned into daily hospital visits then he would have never handed over his cell number this was not what he wanted he wanted healthy friends that he could talk to on a regular basis not one sick friend who hed have to invest personal and emotional time into akaashi swallowed thickly and crossed his hands rubbing one thumb over the other he stared at bokuto and found it difficult to look away with a heavy heart he spokei wish i never met hima cool breeze passed through the garden just then and in the distance bokuto held on tight to the burgundy knit scarf around his neck to keep warm  in time kuroo and kenma found that it was time for them to make their way back home kuroo bid bokuto farewell for the time being while kenma made his way downstairs to exit the building he didnt seem like one to say goodbye  or hello  for that matter so both akaashi and bokuto didnt pay any mind to itkuroo finally left the room after four minutes or so having forgotten that he was supposed to leave in the first place he waved and jogged out knowing that if he didnt hurry hed have to spend several more minutes trying to catch up to a wandering kenmastanding at the side of bokutos bed akaashi glanced to the open door that led to the hallwayyour friend is a lot like youanything but bokuto retorted sitting upright in bed hes a bit more of an ass to say the least he chuckled and rubbed at his face wearilythe sound of bokutos laughter caused akaashi to turn his head back to him it was a reaction that akaashi was not expecting in the least but he played off his surprise and only managed an i seebokuto gazed at akaashi almost in wonder why are you standing take a seat he pat the empty space next to him animatedlyno its alright i was actually thinking of taking my leave soon as wellwhat why the disappointment in his voice was clear youve only been here for like thirty minutesakaashi scratched his head its been over three hours actuallythats the same thing bokuto moved closer to where akaashi was standing all the while still sitting in bed i spoke to kuroo most of the time so it doesnt countwhat doesnt akaashi took an unnoticeable step backthe three hours he was getting frustrated im very bad at measuring time now too if you havent noticed three hours feels like seven hours sometimes but three hours can also feel like seven minutes i may not be as sharp as i used to but that whole time flies when youre having fun rule still applies to me even todayso three hours is nothing akaashi mutteredexactly bokutos eyes lit up againakaashi avoided looking into them i understand but i still have to go he avoided looking at bokuto altogether i would stay if it were up to me ive just got something to take care of but ill be sure to visit you tomorrowbokuto didnt make a sound he pressed his lips into a thin line and fell backwards on his bed he probably had a thousand things to say but he kept them all at bay and instead rolled onto his side facing away from akaashihe was shocked akaashi never knew that bokuto was one to suddenly sulk on a dime he looked around and frowned and figured it would be best to take his leaveill see you tomorrowdo you want your scarf back the question came out of the blue despite him being the one who asked bokuto held onto it tightlyakaashi watched him and zipped up his jacket yeah i doin dismay bokuto sat up in bed and slowly reached around his neck to pull off the warm piece of cloth he took his time the thought of removing it killing him faster than the disease itselfbut i also want you to hold onto itthe words had come as such a shock to bokuto that hed paused and looked up at akaashi his hands tensed relaxed and rested against his neck you doyes akaashi managed the faintest of smiles please hold onto it bokutoat that moment he turned away and walked off feeling he wouldnt be able to leave if hed lasted one more second in the room  akaashi woke with a start that same night his strangled shouts having pulled him from his sleep hed flinched hard and sat up quickly closing his hand over his mouth to subdue the almost hysteric sounds that came from him his breathing was heavy his heart rate quicker than usual akaashi could feel his heart pounding in his throat making it difficult to swallowsh shitthat had been the fifth time that month where akaashi had to tear himself out of another nightmare they made him feel nauseous to a point where he had to sit up in bed and swallow deep slow breaths in order to cool himself down and he did just that reaching his hands up to rub at his eyes before taking a tense look around his roomexhaling heavily akaashi turned to look at the desk near his bed his phone was there hesitating for only a second he reached his hand out and took the device into his hands when the screen lit up a text message from bokuto waited there for himsleep well akaashi it had been sent two hours agoakaashi swiped and unlocked his phone with trembling handsfrom akaashi sent at 247amare you therebokutoyeah akaashi i thought you fell asleepakaashi had to wait almost a minute for bokutos response it was the longest minute hed ever been forced to sit throughakaashii woke up nightmaresbokutonightmare you had a nightmare was it badakaashiwell it managed to wake me upbokutothe quiet kind of wake upakaashino more like the cliched kind where you sit up in bed in a cold sweatbokutoare you calming down are you feeling betterakaashi stared at the text message and let out a shaking sigh judging by his still trembling hands he knew he wasntakaashiyeah im just a little shakenbokutoi dont believe you on that yeah partakaashiim finebokutoalright well well just see about thatfurrowing his brow akaashi stared at his phone screen and lay his head down sideways it wasnt like bokuto to question what he said in such a straightforward fashionakaashitheres nothing to seehe pressed send and watched the phone carefully waiting for the small ellipses to appear on the lower left side of the screen but instead he was greeted with nothing he didnt get a response nor did he see any signs of respondingakaashi frowned and left his phone screen alone to dim and blacken he held it in his shaking hands and closed his eyes in an attempt to try and find sleep again it was difficult however as each time he tried to drift off to sleep that unnerving fear of having the same dream would jerk him back awake akaashi groaned softly and covered his facebzztakaashis phone vibrated against his forehead he flinched and pulled his hand away to stare at the screenbokutolook outside nowhat akaashi kicked his legs out of bed and strode to his window impossible he pulled apart the blinds and looked downout in the dead of night stood bokuto with the burgundy knit scarf around his neck a jacket jeans and slippers he looked up and grinned and waved wildly in akaashis directionakaashis eyes widened no no no no he pulled away from the windowsill and ran out of his room straight downstairs and to the front door he threw it open and faced bokuto who was jogging to him with a smile and a shiver in each stepmay i come inno no werewhy notwere going back to the hospital right now im taking you back akaashi reached his arms out and pushed bokuto awaywhat no bokuto refused to budge he pushed akaashi back this time i just came from thereexactly because you belong there akaashi felt that his words were a bit bitter but he had no other way of telling bokuto the truth youre sick you need medical attentionso i cant sleep bokuto swatted akaashis hands away whats the big dealits more than that he exerted more force into his arms getting bokuto to take a step back youve had two panic attacks this week already and your hallucinations are getting worse my home is not a place for you to be right nowi get panic attacks when youre not around bokuto answered simplemindedly and my hallucinations arent all that badakaashi clenched his jaw behind a mildly irritated face stop trying to act like this isnt such a big deal you may not think it is but i he paused and reached his arms out to get in another shove lets just goi dont want to bokuto grabbed akaashis hands with his ownbokuto stopi dont want to go backhow did you even sneak outby sneaking out they dont pay much attention to me anywaysakaashi yanked his hands away and stared at bokuto as much as it infuriated him he knew that bokuto wasnt going to go anywhere unless he let him into his home first he swallowed thicklyget inside akaashi stepped to the sidebokutos eyes did the familiar light up thing as he bounded into akaashis home he removed his slippers and waited at the entrance for his friend to enter akaashi stepped in and shut the door behind himyou chose the perfect night akaashi said bitterly as he hobbled up the stairs my parents arent homeits not like i wouldve made any noise bokuto all but shouted following after himakaashi sighed ill get you back to the hospital by seven in the morningfine by me imagine the looks on their faces when they see me coming in from the outside imagine their faces when they notice im not even in my room bokuto was elatedakaashi entered his room and shut the door behind bokuto im going straight to sleepbut i thought you had that nightmare bokuto stood at the side of akaashis bedi did he paused for a moment  is that why you came here because of the nightmarebokuto stared at akaashi because you said you were okay and i knew you werentakaashi was at a loss for words he returned bokutos gaze then looked down quickly afterwards a hand tugged at his shirt weakly i see he reached a hand out to turn on the lamp that sat on his nightstandtaking a seat on the edge of the bed bokuto rubbed the back of his neck what was the dream aboutakaashi sat in bed and wrapped a sheet around himself he tossed the navy blue one to bokuto remembering how fond he was of it the last time hed come over he watched as bokuto gathered it up in his arms and threw it around himself he then stared at akaashi waiting for his responsehe sighed i was drowning his hands picked at the small lint rolls that stuck to his sheet drowning in something black sort of like tar i was fighting and trying to get out but i had no power over it whatsoever i was so weak and itd gotten to the point where i could barely breath my face was the only thing sticking out akaashi cocked his head back to demonstrate this with his finger tapping his chini was struggling but in the end i couldnt move i was shouting but no sound came out no one could hear me no one was around akaashi shrugged the liquid started flooding into my mouth and nose and it wasnt until i was suffocating that i forced myself awakeakaashi didnt say another word afterwards he only bundled himself up in the sheets that surrounded him he turned his head to look out the window eyeing the moon timidlyshifting in his seat bokuto pulled himself closer to akaashi one hand grasping the blanket that had been given to himakaashi remained in place with the thought in mind that bokuto would respect his personal space and sit a foot or two away from him but to his apparent surprise bokuto leaned his head on akaashis shoulder and slipped an arm around himakaashi squirmed in discomfort what are you doingcomforting bokuto replied lifting his head isnt that what humans doakaashi watched him carefully dont talk like youre not onebokuto chortled quietly and placed his head back on akaashis shoulder they didnt speak for a moment and the room was filled with the hushed sounds of the outsideheywhatlets watch cloud atlasno akaashi shook his headbokuto grumbled to himself why not dont you have it in your laptopi do but i dont want to watch it its a long movie and ive watched it about seven times alreadywell if youve watched it seven times then why not watch it an eighth timebecause its three in the morning and i want to fit some sleep into my schedule by the time that movie ends itll be six then ill have to walk you to the hospital before the doctors find out youre missing and lose their mindsa laugh escaped bokuto the sound curling his lips into a smile what if theyve already found outthen that would be a problemand then theyd turn my room upside down in an attempt to find methatd be a tough mess to clean upturning his head bokuto looked at akaashi everything you say is so straightforward why is thati dont know akaashi inhaled slowly its just how i am sometimes i think im funny but people never laugh at my jokesbokuto snorted when have you ever tried to make a jokewhen i said that it would be a tough mess for them to clean up akaashi sounded genuinely confused didnt that come off as remotely funnybokuto couldnt help but guffaw his head tilting back that was your idea of a jokeyoure too loud be quiet akaashi shoved his visitor lightly despite this it only seemed to make bokuto laugh even harder akaashi pursed his lips in frustration but this look quickly vanished as a small laugh fell from his lipswell youre laughing now he tried to hide his smile so i guess i am pretty good at being funnybokuto glanced at him yeah but for all the wrong reasons his laughter died down along with akaashis you know i dont think ive ever heard you laugh or seen you smile for that mattershrugging one shoulder akaashi grabbed his phone well now you havebokuto looked over at the phone screen what are you doingsetting an alarm for six am akaashi set his phone down and leaned back slowly resting the back of his head against his pillow bokuto followed his arm still around himthis is strange he stared up at the ceiling and sighed why do i let him do this akaashis head slumped to the side in bokutos directioni hope you dont mind me sleeping he whispered the wordsof course i dont i showed up to your house unannounced at three in the morning youve got all the right to sleepi just hope it isnt rudeit isnt bokutos arm unconsciously squeezed akaashi closer to his sidealright he closed his eyes good night akaashi pulled his arms in close wrapping the sheets around himselfsee you in three hours bokuto whisperedcomplete and utter silence befell them afterwards akaashi had kept his eyes closed for quite a while trying to fall into a deep sleep but found that he couldnt or at least not as quickly as he thought he could he kept his breathing controlled and steady for about forty minutes he looked sound asleep but was actually drifting between the real world and the dream realmthere was silence and then there was a sound a subtle gentle sound the sound of someone cautiously moving their arm when they didnt wish to wake someoneakaashi remained in his faux sleeping position feeling that it would take much more of an effort for him to open his eyes and check around than to stay dormant and so he continued to try and grasp sleep expecting nothing from the noiseit was because of this that he was so surprised when he felt a gentle sensation against his forehead it took all of his power not to flinch when hed felt the unfamiliar touchthey were fingers hesitant fingers that ghosted over akaashis forehead in order to push a loose strand of hair awaykeeping his eyes closed akaashi took in the feeling of this he could sense the heavy amount of reluctance in each movement that bokutos hand carried outbokuto was afraid to wake akaashi so much so that his hands trembled slightly whenever hed push akaashis bangs awayslowly but gradually akaashis heart rate picked up his hands twitched once and he moved closer leaning into bokutos touch this backfired however as the others hand quickly withdrew akaashi relaxed then keeping the sleeping act alivebokuto did not move a muscle after having seen akaashi stir the last thing he wanted to do was wake him up so they lay in silence for minutes on end akaashi figured that bokuto would keep to himself for the rest of the night so he put his focus back to trying to sleep he held the same position and felt himself dozing offim sorry the words were barely a whisper and they came without warning it almost sounded as if bokuto were talking to himselfakaashi remained still and silent i never meant to drag you into my lifebokuto inhaled all that he could akaashi felt his chest rise he could practically hear the frown in his voicei know that im unbearable i know that im a lost cause i know that you know that too and yet you still stick by mehe paused for a moment then spoke up again his voice was a soft tremorso thank youbokuto had nothing more to say after that he lay his cheek on the top of akaashis head and kept still daring not to wake himbut akaashi now couldnt find it in himself to sleep bokutos words haunted him and they repeated themselves over and over in his mind he swallowed once hoping to get rid of the lump in his throat   after that night things had only gone downhill from thenakaashi took a glance out the window only to instantly throw on his clothes and toss his bag over his shoulders he jogged downstairs slipped his shoes on and was out the door in seconds making his way down the familiar route to the hospital above the clouds were dense and they gathered quickly casting a dark shroud over akaashis path he zipped his jacket up to shield himself from the harsh winds that came his way and advanced forward there was definitely a storm coming his way so akaashi knew that bokuto would need hima month and sixteen days had passed since bokutos final visit to akaashis home and once hed been taken back to the hospital the doctors and nurses made sure to keep a closer eye on him and with good reason not only was bokuto the kind of guy to sneak out when no one was watching but his condition had quickly begun to worsen without warning before then he would normally lose several pounds a week but ever since the night hed snuck out his weight loss could only be described as alarming in the span of a little over a month bokuto had gone from a general onehundred and fifty pounds to a mere ninetyseven pounds last time theyd weighed him the drastic weight loss was awful enough but as if to add insult to injury bokutos worsening condition also made it increasingly difficult for him to walk move and speakakaashi frowned heavily as he entered the hospital he made his way up the same path walking swiftly and without pause that was until he saw a familiar facekuroo akaashi stopped in his tracks in front of bokutos roomthe black haired male looked up from his hands he faked a smile hey akaashi right long timeyeah im he turned his head is there someone in there he didnt wait for kuroo to respond and glanced into bokutos room surely enough he noticed kenma sitting in the seat next to bokutos bed his back was facing the door and bokuto seemed to have all of his attention on himwill kenma allow me to enter the roomkuroo rubbed the lower part of his face with his hand nope he leaned back in his chair take a seat kenma usually isnt the kind of person to speak to people one on one so i think youd better leave em both aloneinhaling deeply akaashi lingered in place then sat down in the empty seat next to kurooyou seem a bit anxious kuroo looked at akaashi sidewaysi am theres a storm coming bokuto doesnt do well with thoseah kuroo looked at the ceiling as if he would be able to see the clouds from there i hadnt noticed that one was rolling in he slowly lowered his head and folded his arms didnt think you knew that about himakaashi turned his head to face kuroo was he ever fond of themdont think so in the past hed always get sort of tense and paranoid whenever a storm would pass over head but that was kind of it now i bet he suffers panic attacks because of themakaashi looked down he does storms trigger themkuroo made a grunting noise and had nothing more to say on the subject akaashi figured he should stay quiet too he knit his fingers together and kept his eyes down anticipating when the first boom of thunder would sound he would have to close bokutos blinds and take his mind off of it somehow show him a movie or play a game with him that would result in him to calm down quickly akaashi rubbed the back of his neck hastily and closed his eyesninetyseven fucking poundsstartled akaashi opened his eyes and glanced in kuroos direction he glowered at nothing in particularim sorryninetyseven pounds right thats how much he supposedly weighs nowonce akaashi realized what kuroo was talking about he instantly felt his spirits fall yesfucking bullshit he swore without a filterwincing akaashi turned his head away hed only spoken to kuroo once before and they barely exchanged any words he didnt know how to deal with him now so he remained silent he twisted his fingers and pursed his lips wary of what kuroo would say nextall of this is so ugh why the hell did this have to happen to him and at such an early damn age too he hissed the words under his breath openly frustrated with the situation he turned twenty only three months agoakaashi lowered his head its not fairits not kuroo echoed the words in agreement but here we are and here he iskuroo rubbed his elbow irate and sighed in defeatim not coming back to visit him anymore not after this ive seen enough he turned to look at akaashi keep him company from now on i dont know how you do it but when youre around him you help him forgetakaashi kept his eyes down he wouldnt show this but kuroos words had hit him harder than he could ever imagine they sat heavily in the pit of his stomach churning and pestering him urging him to throw up but he only swallowed and kept his composure just as hed been doing since the day he met bokutoakaashi reached his hand up to rub the back of his neck roughly administering a feeling of discomfort to one area in order to ignore the pain that threatened to swallow his heart he closed his eyes in a slow blink and kept his breathing quiethaving been neck deep in his own sorrows kuroo was blind to akaashis he forced himself to stand after some time tapping his fingers against his pantskeep doing what youre doing his voice was lowakaashi nodded in responseof course i couldnt stop even if i trieda biting chuckle escaped kurooyeah aint that the horror of it all he rubbed his chin and stalked his way down the hall keep in touch akaashiof course he repeated the same phrase finding that it was difficult to search for words at the time he watched as kuroo walked away far enough for small details to become blurred he only looked like a tall thin black mass now as he stood near the stairway he was waiting for kenma but akaashi wondered why he hadnt waited for him in the seat that he was initially sitting injust then as akaashi bit down on the inside of his lower lip he turned his head in time to catch a glimpse of kenma lowering his head towards bokuto it wasnt necessarily a bow it seemed more along the lines of an act of affection or at least as affectionate as kenma could get which wasnt muchhe touched his forehead to bokutos shoulder which only earned a laugh from him bokuto talked quietly in response to kenma gave a nod and smiledhe never seemed to stop smilingonce he saw this kenma picked himself up from his seat put his hands at his side and bowed his head he didnt last another second in bokutos company before he turned and briskly walked out of the room he kept his head down and played the fool pretending he didnt see akaashi in seconds kenma was down the hall and making his way down the stairs having completely ignored kuroo as wellkuroo didnt seem surprised in the slightest he only waved goodbye at a staring akaashi before following his small friend down the stairshesitantly akaashi barely managed to wave back before he heard his name being called from that all too familiar room by that all too familiar voicehe directed his attention to a grinning bokuto who eagerly sat up in bedakaashi almost smiled back and he would have too if it hadnt been for the thunder that sounded its arrival from above he watched as bokutos smile faded instantly his eyes having gone from half lidded to wide in a second his hands squeezed tightly around the navy blue blanket that enveloped himakaashii know he walked ahead quickly straight into the room he pushed the chair away and found bokutos side in bedfrail shaking fingers pushed through his own black and white hair in an attempt to calm himself down but another thunder clap sounded louder that time bokuto flinched hard enough to make the bed shakeffuck his voice broke in terrorlook at me its going to be fine akaashi spoke in a calm slow voice his hand took bokutos own and he held it gently it was cold and shook in short bursts you will get through this you always dostaring down wideeyed at the floor of the hospital room bokuto fought to find wordsakaash ddont bokuto struggled with his breathingdont whatdont lleleave mmei wont leave you he moved closer his other hand taking hold of bokutos just breathe with mebokuto nodded frantically and forced himself to comply with akaashi as he always did he was the only person who could get him through those horrible moments after allheavy raindrops pelted against the window as bokutos frantic sounds filled the room akaashi was glad to have made it in time that had been one of bokutos worst attacks yet  hey akaashihmwhen do you think it will snowi dont know snow falls at randomyeah but do you think it will snow soon or maybe januaryi hope so that would be nice tokyo needs a little more snow now and thenyeah yeah when it falls i want to go out and stand in itakaashi sat cross legged in the seat adjacent to bokutos bed he looked up at the sickly one when hed said those words trying to meet his gaze but ultimately finding no yellow eyes to look into bokuto had his head turned awayhe was staring outside at the white clouds that shrouded the skies mesmerized by just how colorless it made everything seem it was one of those white days as bokuto liked to call them so he paid much more attention to the world beyond the glass than he did to his own confined life in the hospital bokuto breathed in deeply the sound filling the small space around them the bedsheets crumpled beneath his handsare you sure you should be going out in the cold like thati think i can handle itakaashi didnt want to bring up the fact that bokuto probably would no longer possess the ability to walk by the time any snow did get a chance to fall so he kept his mouth shut he rubbed his hands together weakly and tilted his head to the sidei guess you can just as long as youre feeling betterbokuto scoffed it was a quiet soundi am stop asking already that was six days agoi know but it was badit passed bokuto turned his head the pillow crumpling under his neck he looked at akaashi with heavy lidded eyes he was extremely pale and somehow thinner than before but he kept that same smile on his face im fine nowakaashi couldnt help but smile back at him he leaned his chin against the palm of his hand and chortledor at least as fine as you can getbokuto stared at akaashi sharply his lips quivered before he could form his wordsshut up a stronger laugh broke out from him rattling his body as he lay down in bed i look like shit i knowakaashi found himself laughing along with him his quiet chuckle was louder than bokutos wholehearted laughyou dont you dont look like shit he tried to hide his grin with his hand but it was still visible from the gaps between his fingersbokuto reached a hand out aimlessly trying to swat akaashis own hand away he tried to aim for it at the very least but found it difficult to still he continueddont cover thatcover whatyour smilewhy it isnt anything spei barely ever see it bokutos fingers touched at akaashis knuckles that was enough for akaashi to remove his hand from in front his mouth slowly moving it to rest it over his chin he smiled down at himbokutos eyes stared forward with an engrossed gaze his yellow hues taking a mental picture of what he probably would never see again many words dashed through his mind but he could only think of three that would be best for him to say to akaashi he tried to open his mouth to say them but he performed another action instead unconsciously his hand grasped akaashis own and he dragged it down with his lack of strength causing both of them to startle bokutos eyes widenedi i thought you would hold it upit was sudden akaashi stifled a laugh it caught me off guardi didnt mean toits alright he smoothed his thumb over bokutos knuckles im holding it nowsilently and almost in fascination bokuto stared at akaashi once again longer this time before he looked up then down then away he turned his head towards the window away from akaashi he couldnt face himpursing his lips timidly akaashi ceased to speak he studied the back of bokutos head eying the messy strands of black and white hair that overlapped each other his green eyes then fell to study his paling skin his veins were easily noticeable now and they bulged from beneath his flesh whenever he moved akaashis eyes lowered focusing on the arm that was attached to the hand that he was holdinghe studied the small needle that was lodged into bokutos forearm eyed the thin tube that was attached to this and followed it up to the bag of iv fluid that hung above his headwhatever was left of akaashis smile fadedever since bokutos last panic attack it had suddenly become more difficult for him to control his words movements and actions altogether such a task as easy as swallowing was now a problem for bokuto too and after many failed attempts at keeping his food down or getting it to go down in the first place the nurses found it would be best if bokuto received nourishment the only other way possible and that was through a tubeover the span of the six days akaashi found that the only things bokuto could manage to swallow were small snacks like grapes ice cubes and pocky sticks that were specifically strawberry flavored other than those things bokuto found it nearly impossible to stomach anything else his only other choice was to lie there and accept whatever it was the iv liquid had to offer himlooking back to bokuto he was relieved to see that he still had his attention on the window at some time while akaashi was spacing out the blue blanket that surrounded bokuto had been pulled up just below his chin with only his arm hanging out to hold onto akaashis hand bokutos breathing was quiet and his hand never really remained still for a long time it would shake every so often and each time it did akaashi would squeeze lightly in response this was their unspoken communicationit was akaashis way of letting bokuto know that everything would be alright and this would always comfort him no matter the situation they were inthey both found it easier to believe in that lie than to accept the truth of what was to come  on the numbingly cold day that was january 3rd at 804 pm snow had fallen for the first time that year bokuto was the first to notice this but had also been the last to say anything about itit wasnt until akaashi looked up from his laptop screen that he realized it was snowing heavily outside his eyes lit up intent on informing bokuto but when he turned his head to get a look at him instead of being greeted by an over enthusiastic friend he was presented with an unfazed expression upon bokutos weary faceakaashi frownedbokuto dont you see itlooking up from the laptop screen bokuto directed his attention to akaashiwhthe snow its snowing outsidebokuto turned his head to catch another look out the window surely enough snow was falling and in chunks too but this did not grasp bokutos attention frankly speaking it had no affect on him in the slightest he managed a feeble shrug and turned to continue on with the movie that hed watched for the thirtieth time alreadyakaashi was genuinely confusedi thought you were waiting for the snow i thought it was what you wantedhis eyelids drooping and then snapping open again bokuto made a small soundmnh i see it all the timejust then akaashis lips parted in realization bokutos hallucinations had become such a part of him that he thought the snow outside was just another mind trick he breathed in sharplyits not a hallucination bokuto its actually snowing bokuto looked up to stare out the window again there was a longing in his eyes that akaashi couldnt stand to see with barely an ounce of strength left bokuto pulled himself up a tad to get a better look outside curiosity had sparked within him he wanted to know if it was real or not he hated how difficult it had become for him to tell apart the real things from the fake onesill show you akaashi stood from his seat and walked to the windowsill there he parted the glass slightly a gust of icy wind charged its way into the room in an instant draining the warmth from everything it touchedbokutos skin crawled goose bumps pimpling his porcelain surface he pulled the thick blanket over himself with much effortswiftly akaashi closed the window having gathered just enough snow off the edge for him to show to bokuto he strode to him quickly cupping the already melting snow in his hands bokuto held out his own eager to see if it were truesee look akaashi placed the small white compressed lump of snow into bokutos palm this earned a gasp from him bokuto stared down at the white clump of melting ice and with one finger he pressed against it to watch it fall apart the tiny snowflakes deteriorated in the warmth of his palm leaving a small puddle behinda gasp escaped bokuto his eyes widened as much as they couldakaashii knowtake me outsideits freezing akaashi murmured the words and looked bokuto up and down he was nothing more than a blanket with a head you tremble when its seventy degrees in the room right now its about ten degrees outsideplease akaashipressing his lips into a thin slab of a line akaashi shook his head once more he found it much too difficult to say no to bokuto but it had to be donei cantbut why bokutos spirits fell his frown deepthat weather will only hurt you you need to be protectedffrom what bokuto stared at akaashi his features having gone from disappointed to unacceptingakaashi drew in a breath but found that he couldnt say anything he watched bokuto with a wary gaze unaware of what he was to say nextim already in death row i can barely speak i can barely walk i cant eat i cant sleep the llast thing you he clenched his jaw frustrated with himself and the words he spoke  you need to do is worry about me catching a coldbokutoc cold or nnot im still not going to last v very long so please let me have thishis eyes were glued to akaashis and akaashi found that he was unable to look away bokutos eyes said everything to him he translated all that his words could notakaashi looked down and away from bokuto then back to the window i think the window will be as far as we can go he said in a hushed voicethats fine with me and just like that a smile found bokutos face againakaashi sighed to himself frustrated with how easily hed given in to bokutos begging but as he thought of it he figured he couldnt be blamed for it he didnt want to be the one to say no to someone who had little to nothing left in his lifethere was that and the fact that akaashi couldnt help but find bokutos smile endearing no matter how sickly he looked when he wore onecome on akaashi reached a hand out to help bokuto to his feet he urged him to keep the blanket around him but bokuto insisted that he leave it behind he held onto the iv stand with one hand and akaashis hand with his other as he hobbled over to the window bokutos hands were as cold as ice causing akaashis concern in him to grow even more but no matter how much he worried for him akaashi continued on their way to the window at a slow and steady pace until they finally made itonce there bokuto pulled his hand from akaashis and leaned it against the windowsill the air was bitter and cold and it hit bokuto like a slap to the face as another gust of wind forced its way into the hospital room this did not faze him however as bokuto only closed his eyes and inhaled deeply allowing the burn of the winter air to fill his lungs when he exhaled a puff of smoke left him bokuto stuck his head out of the window slightly and kept it there as the snowflakes fell all around himdont do that akaashi pulled bokuto back inside he expected to hear a whine of resistance from him but instead received nothing bokuto only complied and stuck his entire arm out instead watching as each individual snowflake passed around his limb as if none wanted to touch him on occasion one or two would land on him and he would draw his hand in quickly to try and see if he could make out the small pattern on them he would study them for quite a while until they melted and left behind nothing more than a droplet on his arm after this he would repeat the same process paying little to no mind to the freezing cold that surrounded himakaashi watched bokuto mesmerized by his actions he almost portrayed the behaviors of a child sticking to an activity and refusing to let it up repeating whatever he was up to without having anyone to tell him to stop akaashi furrowed his brow and looked outside away from bokuto that familiar feeling of dread was rising from deep within him something akaashi wanted to forget he placed one hand on the windowsill and squeezed his knuckles going whitethey shared another moment of silence something that occurred more often than akaashi would have liked though bokutos speaking skills werent as good as they used to be he was still the more talkative one out of the two so whenever he went silent an unwelcomed feeling of discomfort found its home within akaashi he wanted to rid himself of this feeling rid himself of this silence so he searched his mind in haste for any word that came to mind he needed something  anything  to say to bokuto just so that he could liberate himself of the horrid feeling that threatened to overtake himyou know i never asked akaashi managed to say staring out into the distance why are you so fond of the snow bokutohe waited for an answer but did not receive one unnerved he spoke up againi mean in your state now its a bit cliched dont you think it was his attempt at brightening the mood or being funny as some called it but alas his words had fallen flat on the ground as he received another silent reply from bokuto akaashi frowned deeply he turned his head to get a clear look at bokutos face but instantly wished he hadntin his silence bokuto wept to himself fat tears rolling down his cheeks in numbers the hand that supported his weight against the windowsill trembled without pause and his other remained outside shaking in the cold dead of night several flakes had gathered on the outstretched limb but they were not quick to melt they settled there deeming bokuto one of them for the remainder of their frozen lives before they eventually melted or fell awayakaashi stared at bokuto opened his mouth to say something but found that he couldnt form even one simple word realizing this akaashi decided to take action instead and reach out to comfort him but not even this he could do his arms and legs were stiff as were his eyes all he could do was stare at the melancholic performance that played out before himdo something akaashi closed his mouth and swalloweddo something anythingakaashis body didnt respondhe could only watch as those tears fell at a faster pace down onto his hospital gown and onto the floor the light that came from outside reflected off of bokutos teardrops lighting his face up in the most gentle of ways eventually bokuto drew back his hand and let it fall to his side he hung his head and tried to keep his crying controlled in the best way possible but this proved to be very difficult as sobs broke out of him causing his entire being to shakeafter a moment of trying to gather himself bokuto choked out two simple words with quivering lipswhy meakaashi stared on as his mind searched for words he found some and said them without a second thoughtbecause life is unfairbokuto reached up a cold frail hand to wipe at the mess that was his face i wanted to do sso many thingsi know akaashi balled his hand into a fist mentally scolding himself for the present lack of emotion in his voiceas bokuto backed away from the window akaashi was quick to close it locking the bitter night air out of the room for the remainder of the night he then reached out and took hold of bokutos arm to help him back to the bedonce theyd reached it bokuto resumed his usual position and wrapped the thick blanket around himself then turned away from akaashi he watched the window quietly paying no mind to his visitor or so akaashi thought in a matter of minutes just as akaashi had started to fidget bokuto spoke upakaashiyes his undivided attention was on bokutohe hesitated for a moment but finally spoke up i dont want you to visit me anymoreakaashis eyes squinted to the words and he leaned forward in shock whatplease dont visit me anymoreno akaashi stood from his seatpleaseno its a little too late for that bokuto a shiver racked akaashi causing the hairs on the back of his neck to standakaashi pleaseno is my final answer he stalked over to the other side of the bed where he would be able to look at bokutos face once bokuto noticed this he turned his head and slowly rolled away akaashis eyes widened his emotions now falling victim to a strange mix of fear and furybokuto what is the meaning of thisbokuto didnt respond he remained in the same position and only moved his hand to wipe at his face againanswer mesucking his teeth bokuto pulled the blanket up to just beneath his chin it took some time but he finally answeredi dont want you to grow any mmore attached to me ththan yyou already areakaashi nearly scoffed what makes you think im attached to you i never said that i wasthis time bokuto directed his attention to akaashi he wore a grimace upon his reddened faceshshut up akaashi he breathed in deeply frustrated with himself and the gradual growth of his speech impediment but continued on i know you hate hospitals dont come telling mme now that you have only been coming here every day because yyou wanted toakaashi had nothing else to say he stared at bokuto with his lips parted as if he were going to speak but ended up speechlessi know that you care ev even if its just a little bit bokuto covered his mouth and coughed suddenly he found that speaking was taking much more energy than he thought still he continued to talk i dont know much about this disease partly because i was too afraid to read up on it but i know i dont have much time left his frustration slowly faded and all that was left behind upon his pale face was a look of defeatone maybe two months at most if im lucky thats how long i know i have leftthe air around akaashi thickened and suddenly he found it difficult to breathebokuto looked down and twisted his lips to the side i heard the doctors talking they dont know how to hheal me so from beneath the blanket akaashi could see bokutos shoulders rise and fall its just a slow downhill ride ffrom here and i ddont want you to see it all hhappenbokuto lay there glasseyed his welled up tears glinting in the dim lighting of the roomi dont want you to watch me decaysmall tears spilled out of bokutos eyes and rolled down his hauntingly placid features so i figured if you left now you wouldnt have to and it wouldnt hhurt so muchonce again that crippling spell took hold of him and akaashi couldnt move nor could he speak all he could do was watch in muted anguish as bokuto finally accepted what had become of his short lived life akaashi realized that those smiles hed seen before were smiles of denial  forced grins that tried desperately to trick bokuto into thinking that everything would be fine but he couldnt keep it up forever not in the state that he was in bokuto had always been struggling to keep a positive front but inside he was falling apart all alongakaashi knew this nowin an attempt to move he tapped his fingers against his legs at an impatient pace he was trying everything he could to psych himself into doing at least something to let bokuto know that he was there for himdo something as if he were one of the living dead akaashi forced one leg forward then the next until he was touching the bed side he pushed his negative thoughts aside and sat himself down in bed right next to bokuto akaashi did not give him time to react to this as he moved closer still and when he was close enough he lowered his head to lean it on bokutos shoulderakaashi squeezed his hands together to keep them from shaking uncontrollablyim not leaving koutarou his voice was hushed gentle and nothing you say will make me leavebokuto kept silent not a word left him even as he reached a hand up to wipe at his face again he only sniffed on occasion and shifted in place but never did he say anything to oppose akaashis decisionhe was gladakaashi turned his head slightly his cheek gently resting on bokutos shoulder he took in a slow deep breath and closed his eyes and his eyebrows knit together for only a second his hands quivered as he dug his nails into his knucklesbokuto no longer smelled like a hospitalbokuto smelled like home  the reflection of ending movie credits could be seen in akaashis eyes as they scrolled up along the screen of his laptopsitting back he reached a hand out and paused the movie thatd been on screenso how was it watching the movie for the thousandth time there was almost a hint of sarcasm in his voicelying next to akaashi a ghostly pale bokuto smiledgood bokuto eased back and buried his head into his pillow he looked in akaashis direction it took a moment for bokuto to focus on himpulling his laptop close akaashi smoothed his finger along the mouse pad he looked to the lower right corner of the screen january 19th 640pmakaashi pulled a solemn face and closed the laptop he moved in his seat and sat straight against the head of the bed then looked down at bokutohis tired eyes were on akaashi he was grinningforcing a smile of his own akaashi tilted his head only slightlywhat are you smiling at he reached a hand out and touched bokutos forehead he was cool to the touch  colder than most akaashi was quick to withdraw his hand but he managed it discretelyit took a moment for bokuto to respond but after some time he managed some words thank youdont worry about it a sheepish grin curled akaashis lips i know youre fond of that movie he looked down at bokuto as he said this and glanced away soon after something told him that those words werent meant for the movie but akaashi shoved this thought awayhe twisted his body to reach for the box of pocky that sat on the counter he opened it and pulled one outdo you want onebokuto nodded and stretched a wobbling arm out akaashi placed it in between his fingers and bokuto retracted his hand to hold the biscuit snack against himself he held it to his nose with some difficulty and breathed in the strawberry scent then let his arm fall he touched at it lightly twirled it shakily between his fingers and studied it but he never ate itakaashi placed the box back onto the counter and huffed softlyyou seem to have grown more attached to that pocky stick than mebokuto looked up surprised and glanced back down at the snack in his hands it took time for akaashis words to reach him but when they finally did his face lit up as he broke out in laughterit was the weakest sound akaashi had ever heardah ive finally said something funny akaashi chuckled with bokuto folding his arms in the process i told you i had my moments every so oftenbokutos laughter died down and he closed his eyesrarelygive me a break here akaashis chortling had been dragged out for a few seconds longer before he too quieted downthey remained speechless in each others company for several minutes before bokuto actually spoke up his voice sounding like nothing more than a mere whisperkeijiakaashi looked at himmhmbokuto swallowed thickly and toyed with the pocky in his handask mme w why i like cloud atlas so muchperplexed akaashi directed his full attention to bokutowell alright koutarou why do you like cloud atlas so much he watched bokuto intently curious to know what his answer would belooking up at akaashi with eager eyes as if hed been asked the question out of his own free will bokuto gladly answereds so you know in the mmovie when th characters die in one life he kept his weary yellow eyes on akaashi waiting for him to nod once he did bokuto continued wwell i like it when ththey find each other again in another lifebokutos voice was soft measly and carried no force to it but as he spoke about his favorite scene akaashi could sense a powerful vibe coming from him one that wasnt there beforea hopeful oneit mmakes me feel like ill hhave another life one beyond this one one thats better wh where i can actually wake up to you and be with y you a smile played on his pale thin lips one where we can live nnormal lives instead of living this oneakaashi couldnt find any words to say at that moment he stared at bokuto and could only nod with whatever it was he thought he was agreeing with he felt as if all the air had been squeezed out of his body by the words that bokuto had spokenof all the things that bokuto found most endearing of the movie akaashi never thought it would be thatmanaging a miserable smile akaashi roughly rubbed his palm with his thumbyou know i would like that very much he spoke gently in bokutos directionme too bokutos eyes never left akaashi he stared at him intently and watched every move he made to the point where this had captured akaashis attentionwhy do you watch me like that his emerald eyes met golden onesthough the question was asked clearly bokuto didnt make a sound nor did he move he instead continued to stare in akaashis direction with hopeful eyesafter what felt like the longest ten seconds of his life a sudden shudder charged down akaashis spine causing goose bumps to rise on his flesh he held his breath then proceeded to ask againkoutarou why do you watch me like that it took every fiber of his being to keep his voice from tremblingit was then that bokutos eyes blinked in realization and slowly but surely he moved his lips to answerjust because he replied in what almost sounded like a surprised tone i didnt want you to leave sometimes when i blink you arent there anymore bokuto rubbed one of his eyes then the other and let his hand drop to his sidesakaashi tried to hide his frown his eyes looked down at bokutos hands they were thin and bony and he could see those smooth blue veins curling over the bones beneath his fleshhe reached a hand out and took bokutos hand in his ownbokutos automatic reaction to the warmth was to curl his fingers around akaashis grasp he looked at him and exhaled through his nose quietlyakaashi met his gaze then looked downdont worry im still herebokuto nodded feebly against his pillowim still here too his voice was weaker than before if possibleakaashi nodded with himyeah youre still here toowith what little strength he had left bokuto beamedakaashi wished he could do the same  new messagefrom kuroo sent january 31st at 225 pmhey are you thereakaashiyes i amkuroohow are thingsakaashithings could be better things could be worsekuroomay i ask how bokuto is doingakaashihes hanging onkuroocan he still walk or talkakaashino he cant he lost the ability to walk a little more than a week ago his ability to speak left him soon afterkurooi see you really are straightforward arent youakaashii dont know any other way to put it sorryakaashi looked up from his phone after sending the message and turned his head to notice that bokuto was once again staring at him with acute interesthis eyes read whos thatstuffing his phone in his pocket akaashi shruggedjust kuroo he said the name with a lack of interest to try and soften the blow but akaashi knew that no matter how he approached it bokuto would frown when he heard the nameand he didbokuto looked down at akaashis hand his eyes gave away just how much he missed his friend feeling an amount of guilt build up within his chest akaashi pulled out his phone just as quickly as hed hid it awaywould you like for him to send a photobokuto looked back up and thought for a moment then noddedplaying off of this akaashi texted for kuroo to send an image of himself for bokuto to see it took quite some time for a message from kuroo to arrive but when it did akaashi realized that hed sent a video instead of what was initially asked forakaashi leaned over in his seat to move himself closer to bokuto with one elbow on the bed he held his phone so that the both of them could see bokuto stared at the screen with interested eyes wondering what the content would consist of akaashi pressed play and a video of kuroo started to playhe sat at home in bed with a snug fitting shirt on and his hair an absolute messwhats up guys ahhhh i know you didnt tell me to send a video but im not someone who follows rules he pulled a mock cool expression but this was cut short as someone else spoke upfrom the background of the video a low voice could be heardwhat did you just say that to yourselfno wow no im taking a videokuroo panned the phone to his side and a blurred kenma came into focus on screen he sat crosslegged with a shirt on that was two sizes too big and a hat that looked as if it had been placed on his head without his consent his head was down and his fingers moved swiftly over the buttons on the gaming device that he held in his hands at one point he reached a hand up to grab the beanie off of his head and he aimlessly chucked it to the ground with forcesay hi kenmawait what i didnt hear what you said kenma looked up and was greeted with a front facing camera he quickly got up from the bed and walked off dont record meat least say hi kuroo calledhi the disembodied voice came from off screenand thats kenma for you kuroo groaned as he repositioned himself in bed and then he smiled but putting him aside i hope all is well um he scratched at his cheek just below his eye i miss you guys i miss you especially bokuto um hang in there alright akaashi dont give him a hard time or you and i are going to fucking fightbokuto smiled wide to those words he would have laughed if he coulda grin ghosted across akaashis lips as well but it was quick to vanishwell i guess thats it for now i would have kenma say bye too but he turned his head to look around he left the room yeah he left the room so ill just say bye for him see you bokuto keep it cool and remember youre the best he held his hand up in a peace sign and the video ended with him on screenakaashi sighed he thought the video had gone by too quickly but it had actually lasted a little under thirty secondsfor a guy whos name is kuroo he sure is a colorful one akaashi sat up and placed his phone on the counterbokuto nodded and looked up at akaashi once againyou guys were best friends huhbokuto nodded once more he struggled to raise a hand and slowly he twirled his index finger in circles at the side of his headakaashi snorted softly and leaned back in his seatis he crazythe smile on bokutos lips grew just a little more signifying that hed answered yes to akaashis questionit was moments like these that made akaashi realize just how much of an innocent soul bokuto really was every now and then it would come to him that bokuto was only twenty years old and that fact would only weigh akaashi down even more than it usually did it hurt him to think that bokuto had barely even experienced the joys of a young adults life before that crippling disease had taken a hold of him it was frustrating it was infuriating and it was overall saddening but akaashi could not show any of this not in front of bokutoso instead of putting on a sour expression akaashi only kept a neutral one like he always did it was his best and only way to hide his pain  several hours had passed since the message from kuroo and both bokuto and akaashi didnt do muchwithout a voice bokuto couldnt keep up a conversation as well as he used to no matter how hard he tried and even if he could speak he wouldnt have been able to talk for long considering the state he was in his movements were uncoordinated and slow and the only sounds he could manage were meek and most of the time inaudible at times bokuto would do nothing but lie there in bed twitching back awake whenever his body tried so desperately to fall into the sleeping state that it once knew when this would happen hed pull a frustrated expression for only a moment before his face grew too tired to hold it any longerwhen bokuto was like this akaashi would normally look away to spare himself the sight of it all but on rare occasions there were times when hed have no choice but to watch bokuto fall apart at the hands of his illness and he hated itfor every time akaashi would witness this his mind would repeat one phrase whether he wanted to hear it or notthis is what a dying person looks likelooking down swiftly akaashis sights locked onto his hands he glared at them intensely with that same placid expression of his making this look all the more unnerving he wanted the thought to leave his mind he wanted nothing to do with it he forced those words away and replaced them with new ones ones that said hes not dying hes going to be finebut as he thought of it as he narrowed down the true meanings of both phrases he ultimately could not decide which of the two were more horrifyingakaashi closed his eyes and heaved out a sigh feeling more and more hopeless with each passing second he feared he wouldnt be able to pull himself out of this state but then it occurred to him that he was not alone in thishe felt the gentlest of taps against his arm and he turned his head to meet eyes that were as concerned as they were exhausted akaashi sat up straight and composed himselfim fine he commented softly leaning back in his seat how are you feeling koutaroubokuto blinked slowly this was his way of saying he was feeling alright not great but alrightakaashi pursed his lips and nodded once he found himself unable to say anything else figuring that bokuto wouldnt have anything to say either but he was wrongagain he felt the light tapping against his arm surprised akaashi gave bokuto his attention againhm what is it he turned the chair so that he was now facing bokuto from the frontgazing up at akaashi bokuto frowned and tried to form some words but failed in the end he looked around and moved his fingers trying to make out a phone akaashi picked this up quickly and he pulled his phone out for bokuto to use he opened his notes application and held the device in front of bokuto it was then that he started to inaccurately press at words that he was trying to make out it took him some time to get down what he wanted to say but after several minutes he withdrew his handakaashi looked at his phone to read the sentence it readif i knew those words i spoke a week ago would have been my last i would have chosen them more carefullyakaashi stared intensely at the screen then tore his gaze away and looked back to bokutoyou werent happy with those wordsslowly bokuto noddedwell then if you had a second chance akaashi hesitated he almost didnt want to ask the question what would you have chosen to sayjust as those words left akaashis mouth the clouds outside parted allowing the setting suns orange light to flood into the room it illuminated both bokuto and akaashi and they squinted at the same time despite this akaashi did not miss the look of slight nervousness that claimed bokutos featureshe was now more curious than hed ever been beforeum bokuto you dont have to say it now if you dont want tobokuto shook his headso you dont want tohe shook his head again stronger this timeah you do want to say it nowthis time a weak sound left bokutos throat through a closed mouth and he noddedalright akaashi shifted in his seat now timid he glanced to the side how many words are there in what you want to say i meanresponding as slowly as ever bokuto raised one hand on that one hand three fingers stuck outakaashi felt his heart sink to his stomach another shudder threatened to rattle him but he kept himself still as difficult as that wasthree words thats all akaashi forced a smile they felt mandatory now thats interestingplease please dont say them he reached his arm out and held his phone in front of bokuto for him to typeplease dont type them i dont want to hear them i dont want to read them i dont want to know themfor what felt like an eternity bokuto typed the words on akaashis phone his hand wobbled so much that it was impossible to decipher which letters he was hitting akaashi was close to holding his breath before bokuto had finally drew his hand back he let it fall over his stomach and there it rested his golden eyes searched the room for akaashi when hed finally found him those shining eyes of his lit up just a little more than usual and with that glint came his smile it was small and measly but thereakaashi made sure to take a mental picture of this before he looked down and closed his eyes he gripped his phone in his hand and took in a deep breath filling his lungs with all the air that he could before he exhaled through his nostrils he turned his phone so that it was facing him opened his eyes and read the three words that would haunt him forever or so he thoughtakaashis eyes widened slightly and his eyebrows knit together in surprise what sat upon the screen was not what he thought it would be but rather a simple complimentyou are beautifulfreezing in his seat akaashi read the words ten times over before he finally looked up he could feel his heartbeat thumping hard against his chest as if it wanted to break free his eyes locked onto bokutosyou think that im beautiful he asked this in a tone of disbeliefmustering a weak nod bokutos lips curled at the sides just a bit more with this he raised a quivering hand and his index finger he was trying to tell akaashi something elseguessing quickly akaashi muttered onebokuto kept his finger up then moved his hand to point it at himself he did not give akaashi time to voice his guess as he then moved his finger to point at his eye then finally at akaashiweakly akaashi parted his lips he almost couldnt find his voice but when he did he tried his best to keep it from shakingsince the first day you saw meto this bokutos arm fell and rested lightly on his stomach he did the only thing that he could and nodded again then closed his eyes and slightly turned his head awayakaashi watched curiously as bokutos lips quivered into a wide grin and as the light captured his features akaashi realized just how embarrassed bokuto actually washis face glowed the quietest shade of red and he tried to hide it from akaashi it seemed that after finally hearing his pent up thoughts aloud they had frayed his nerves more than he thought they wouldseeing this display unfold before him akaashi could barely think his heart beat a mile a minute he found it difficult to swallow and one of his legs bounced up and down rapidly he didnt know how to react didnt know what to do or say but as he searched for the right words to speak or the right thing to do akaashi found himself doing something he didnt expect of himselfa light hearted laugh bubbled out from deep within his chest and the sound filled the room as soon as it hit the air he laughed hard or at least as hard as he could his voice was gentle light on bokutos ears it caused him to open his eyes and look in akaashis direction astonished those honeyhued eyes took in all that they could of akaashis laughing face the way his lips curled at the corners the way his eyes squinted just enough so that only a glint of green could be seen bokuto captured it all and in no time he found himself laughing tooit was a quiet laugh it was so weak and feeble it could barely be heard but it was there and akaashi could hear it so that was enough for bokuto his face still wore the same shade of red but he no longer minded this he was happy where he was he was happy that hed admitted those words he was glad that akaashi found company in himfinding a breath between his laughter akaashi managed to speakyoure ridiculous he said lightheartedly his fingers trembling around his phonebokuto gave him a look that could only be read as i am arent islowly akaashis laugh eased into a chuckle and as he sat there in his seat he looked down at bokuto with placid eyes a genuine expression made its home on akaashis features and a hand reached up to push through his raven locksthank you koutarou he whispered softly his voice shaking in his throat he reached a hand out and found bokutosbokuto tightened his grasp in that automatic way he always did he stared up at akaashi with that smile that never seemed to fade his eyes readyoure welcome keiji  february 2ndwhat time is itakaashi stirred in bed slightly and let out a weak grunt he didnt bother to check he didnt carethe sky was already black he figured it was already past five in the afternoon so he didnt care anymore he didnt care if it was seven at night or eight at night or twelve in the morning or if the worlds clock stopped moving altogetherall he cared about was the fact that bokuto was still with him next to him breathing aliveall he cared about was the fact that bokuto koutarou was still thereakaashi moved his head to the side and touched his forehead to bokutos neckbokutos movements were late to this but he reacted nonetheless as he turned akaashis way to touch his chin to the top of his head the soft touch of akaashis hair against his chin comforted bokuto and pulled him into a relaxed stateakaashi liked it when this happened it would cause less spasms to grip bokutos body allowing him to unwind more than he usually could akaashi didnt know why he had this effect on him but he did and that was all that mattered to himthe day was exceptionally cold but akaashi was glad to know that the hospitals room provided enough heat to keep bokuto from freezing over but even so bokuto still suffered from trembling spells and they would come in small short bursts and last only several seconds before his body became too weak to keep it upakaashi always made sure to hold bokuto close and squeeze him tight whenever this happened just to let him know that he was there for him that he wasnt another one of those illusions his mind would create akaashi would also murmur quiet things to him from time to time to keep up a small often one sided conversation hed usually ask yes or no questions ones that were easy for bokuto to answer with a nod or shake of the head but sometimes he wouldnt answer certain questions despite akaashi asking them twicehe wouldnt always get answers akaashi was aware of this but he would still ask him things at other times he would just tell him things that were on his mindit was strange how the less bokuto asked the more akaashi found himself sayingrelaxing his head against the crook of bokutos neck akaashi blinked wearily and stared off into the distance he focused on nothing something he remembered kenma doing his hand held onto one of bokutos very thin arms and his thumb would occasionally rub up and down to comfort him they shared the same navy blue knit blanket and huddled up beneath it keeping each other warm in the best way that they could as akaashi lay there quiet listening to bokutos strained breathing he opened his mouth to speakkoutarouhe spoke just loudly enough for bokuto to hear him he felt him move against his head in response so he continued he drew in a deep breath and blinked away the stinging in his eyesi want you to know that i dont regret meeting youbokuto didnt move much he just breathed nowi am very happy to have met you and to have gotten to know youakaashi paused for a long moment and said nothing for a while but then he spoke up againso thank you koutarou for talking to me me in the hall that day and asking me if i was alright because i wasnt then but i am nowslipping his head down to bokutos chest akaashi leaned against his frail frame akaashi listened to the quickened rate of bokutos still beating heart and knew that this was his response to his wordsakaashi closed his eyes against him he found he had nothing more to say he instead allowed his actions to speak for him he pulled himself closer to bokuto and nudged his face into the warmth of his neck he could feel bokutos chin rubbing against the top of his head like it always did it never failed to comfort akaashi he breathed in that familiar scent that hed grown so attached to then exhaled quietly against bokutos prominent collar boneakaashi could feel a weak ailing arm pull itself up to rest upon his shoulder to this he shifted in closer and allowed his body to relax his breathing evened out and in no time he could feel himself slipping slowly into the warm grasp of sleep unable to resistin a daze akaashis last words were good night koutarou before he slipped off into a deep sleephe dreamt of nothing in particular that night he suffered no nightmares nor did he see anything remotely close to a dream there was nothing there was only blackness  akaashi woke up to the feeling of sunlight against his face it was warm on him certainly something that one would find comforting but as he stirred in bed he was certain that something was offhe kept his eyes halflidded and his movements reserved clinging onto the false hope that bokuto wasnt moving because he didnt want to wake him but akaashi knew that this wasnt the case he just didnt want to accept itstretching out a trembling arm akaashi took hold of bokutos hand he shut his eyes and squeezed his palm it was cold his hand trembled harder with each passing second as if the movement would cause bokuto to wake up akaashis face buried into the crook of his neck he nudged the bridge of his nose against the cool skin his lips brushed against his collarbone in desperate search of that familiar warmth both hands had clasped around bokutos own now quavering without pause he couldnt find his pulsedevastation weighed down on akaashi in that instant it was a surreal feeling one that he could never in one million years describe it squeezed him threatening to crush him from the inside out the pain seared itself into his soul hindering him rendering him speechless to a point where he no longer knew what words werea sob wretched its way out from akaashis throathe tried desperately to hold it in tried so hard to keep himself together but he knew he was too weak to pull such a bluff once the second sob had left him he felt himself spiraling there was no hiding it he was undonehis body jerked with each sob that was torn from him his frame curling to bring himself closer he held his face against the corpses neck just beneath the jawline breathing in all that was left of bokutohe had so many things hed wanted to do with him so many things hed wanted to say but all of those things seemed to have fallen away once the moment had finally come akaashi wanted to scream but he couldnt find his voice not even a sentence could get past his sufferinghe kept himself against bokuto and held onto him with what little strength he had left in him he didnt get up to alert the nurses or the doctors or anyone in the hospital he knew that once they found out they would take bokuto away from himso he stayed in place holding onto bokuto taking in his company for one last time before hed never see him again  once akaashi had left the hospital he never looked backhe walked home that day with a balled up blanket in his arms a burgundy scarf around his neck and nothing more from the hospital he held them against his frame in the twenty degree weather and though many people gave him strange looks and watched him sideways none of this affected him in the slightest the cold was no longer a factor to akaashi he couldnt feel it his mind wouldnt allow him tohe made it home without so much as a hello to his parents who sat in the living room they asked him questions he answered blatantly they asked about the blanket and the scarf but they never asked about bokutoakaashi was glad it was a good idea to have never told them about him after allhe ascended the steps to his room balled his  no  bokutos blanket up into a lump and dropped it onto his bed along with the scarf he reached into his pocket to fish out his phone and pushed call on one of his contacts he held it up to his ear and waited for the other line to pick up once it did akaashi was greeted with a helloakaashi hesitated he swallowed thickly and looked out the windowhello kuroo its akaashi are you busykuroos voice was reserved and reluctantno im notif it isnt too much trouble may i come overkuroo was quiet on the other end he already knew he inhaled audibly and akaashi could hear a scratching sound after a moment he finally spoke his voice was solemnsure  akaashi sat at the edge of kuroos bed and he stared out the window without focus kuroo spoke to him and akaashi listened and often responded but most of the time he only sat there and continued to watch nothingkuroo would have been concerned if not for finding out what had happened earlier that day he was much like akaashi sitting on the same side of the bed a good distance apart from his visitor those yellow eyes of his would often dart to the floor then to the ceiling around the room and back to the floor but he would never look at akaashihe feared that if he did he wouldnt be able to keep his emotions at bayhow did he look kuroo asked with a hushed toneit took akaashi a while to respondwhen i woke upyeah kuroo looked downakaashi let out a halfassed grunt and continued to stare forwardpale sick deadhow did you find out that he wasnt there anymorehis entire body was relaxed his head rested on mine with the weight of someones whos unconsciousthis time kuroo was the one to grunt the sound coming from deep within his chest he was slow to speak up again but did either wayare you going to his funeralnothe answer came so much more quickly than kuroo thought it would it shocked him as akaashi continuedi refuse to go my last memory of bokuto will not be of him sharply dressed pale stiff and stuffed in a casket surrounded by a countless amount of people who did not care for him at all until the day they heard about his death my last memory of koutaro is already with me and it will die along with meakaashis tone was monotonous but kuroo didnt fail to detect the venom that lined each word prior to his last sentence he understood where akaashi was coming from and didnt even think of holding his icy tone against him kuroo was just as bitter he too did not intend on showing up to any funeral hed be furious with everyone in there and he knew that the same pain burned within akaashi tookuroo leaned forward and joined his hands together he stared at the wall and bounced one leg up and down as his emotions slowly started to reclaim himyou know um he looked down and rubbed his neck roughly leaving behind deep red marks bokuto he he really liked uh cared about you he talked about you all the time when he first met ydontkuroo froze with his hand clinging to his neck he slowly looked up to find that akaashi was staring back at him with vacant eyes void of all known emotiondont kuroo just donthe swallowed thick and turned his head to stare out the window again akaashi laced his fingers together and dug his nails into the backs of his hands he was redirecting the painsorry it was the last word kuroo murmured before he stared forward as well having nothing more to saythey shared each others company in silence for what felt like the length of five minutes and in that time akaashi never once looked to the side to catch a glimpse at kuroo it wasnt until he watched kuroos form double over in his peripheral that akaashi did glance in his direction and when he did he was greeted with a quietly sobbing kuroo his face having been buried in the palms of his hands though is was delayed akaashi moved on instinct and sat near kuroo he placed a hand on his broad back and rubbed gently hoping to comfort him and to be the stronger of the two but as each second passed akaashi could feel his own pain building up more and more within him he wished he could fight it but he knew there was no possible way for him toit wasnt long before akaashi had leaned his head on kuroos shoulder as he too fell victim to the sorrow that slowly ate him alive  it had been three days since bokutos passing and surely enough sleep did not come to akaashi as easily as it used to in the span of those three days he had only acquired a little over four hours of sleep in total on the first night out of the three akaashi flat out refused to get any rest in fear of suffering another night terror but during the other two nights he surely did make the effort to try and lull himself to sleep but each time he did he either found himself stirring awake from a strange dream or lying wide awake in the middle of the night half expecting to receive a message from bokutoat times akaashi would look through the conversations that hed shared with him hed scroll up up up until the first text then would scroll all the way down again waiting for the ellipse to appear on the lower left side of the screen but always hed receive nothingthat night was no different as akaashi repeated this action for the twentieth time that day his thumb scrolling up and down for minutes on end until he finally came to a stop when he had however instead of shutting his phone off and trying to force a few hours of sleep upon himself akaashi stared at the phone screen longingly and read the last messages that were sent between thembokuto sent at 215 am december 20thhey akaashiiiii are you awakeakaashiyes i am what is itbokutoim excited for you to come over tomorrowakaashii visit you every day thoughbokutoi know you never miss a day dont your parents ever ask why you come here so muchakaashithey think im interning so they dont mindbokutooh works for me 9 o wakaashii would hope so it works for me as well ill be sure to bring my laptop when i visit we can watch cloud atlas againbokutoyes please thank you akaashidecember 20th at 345 amyou probably fell asleep sorry for always messaging you so late sleep well akaashi ill see you soonakaashi frowned and felt that familiar pain pierce his chest he reread sleep well akaashi and inhaled with frailtyim tryinghe couldnt bring himself to read over the last four words of the text again and ultimately shut off his phone he placed it on the counter near his bedside and buried himself into the blanket that he had so openly shared with bokuto akaashi inhaled deeply and closed his eyes his eyebrows knitting together as his brow creased it still smelled like himakaashi relaxed himself against his mattress and closed his eyes a powerless yawn leaving him his head eased into his pillow and to his surprise within a matter of minutes he could feel himself slipping it felt strange not falling asleep against bokutos body but akaashi knew that he would have to get used to this form of sleeping by his lonesome once again he just hoped that the night wouldnt bring him any malevolent dreams all he wanted was to see bokuto again even if just for a second an exhausted breath left him and akaashi finally fell asleepthat night he dreamt of the first night bokuto had come over his home he dreamt of how bokuto had buried himself into the navy blue blanket to watch the movie that played on the laptop screen and how he held bokuto in his arms that night to aid him in his attempt to sleep he could still remember the small details like how bokutos starry shirt would slip off his shoulder every so often when he stirred in bed and how the feel of bokutos weight on him would take his breath away akaashi could still feel the sensation of his wild white and black hair brushing against his cheek whenever he moved and the warmth that came from him as he held him close it was all still there but there was something different about it all that puzzled akaashiat one point in his dream akaashi looked out the window the night sky had suddenly become a pale blue and the warm orange glow of the sun slowly spread across the horizon he turned his head slowly to look at bokuto and watched him as he lay in his arms akaashi said his name and to this bokuto stirred awake he turned his head and met akaashis gaze with weary well rested eyes he stretched and stifled a yawn pushed a hand through the mess that was his hair and relaxed his head against akaashis shouldersunlight broke into the room cascading all along the walls and floor and casting shadows all around it lit bokutos face up just enough for akaashi to take in those healthy features that were staring back at him he felt his heart rate accelerate and his throat tightened as his vision blurred bokuto beamed at him with a smile that spoke a thousand words and his hand reached out to touch akaashis cheek akaashi felt his palm warm full caressing the round of his face he leaned into his touch and his vision began to fade his eyes welling with tearsbokuto leaned in and touched his forehead to akaashis he was only a blurred shape now but akaashi knew he was still there bokuto spoke his voice peaceful healthy wholei found youa trembling tender laugh escaped akaashi he smiledyou found me'"
