Digital Humanities project analyzing the language of fanfiction, pulled from the top 3.5k works on Archive of Our Own. 

# Datasets
Using [a webscraper by UC Berkeley graduate student Sarah Sterman and Stanford student Jingyi Li](https://github.com/radiolarian/AO3Scraper), I collected the data and full text from the top 3.5k works (aka "fics"), as sorted by likes (or as Ao3 calls them, kudos) of fanfiction on the popular fanfiction website [Archive of Our Own](https://archiveofourown.org/), as well as samples of other fandoms and searches for the purposes of comparison.

# About the Project
Reading fanfiction feels different than reading traditionally published literature. While fanfiction might come with popular connotations of being romantic or sexual in nature, fanfiction is more of a mode of writing than it is one specific genre. Using The user generated tagging systems and topic modelling, I want to figure out what makes fanfiction what it is. What topics are most popular, and how do people categorize them? In a future project, I intend to do a similar analysis of popular published literature, but this serves as a starting point for comparing fanfiction to standardized literary forms. Fanfiction has often been studied as a cultural, psychological object, but lacks research as a form of literature, and I want to investigate why it is or why it might not be.

Most of the code here was written referencing [the notebooks in this GitHub repo from the Berkeley D-Lab, written by Evan Muzzall and edited by Brooks Jessup](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/DIGHUM101-2021).

# Research Questions
1. Primary Research Question. How is fanfiction tagged, and what does this categorization say about fanfiction as a whole?

    a. Are there any specific names or relationships that show up disproportionately?
    
    b. What are the percentages of M/M stories, F/F stories, F/M stories, and other gender combinations? What might that say about the genre? 
    
    c. How popular is fanfiction? How popular are specific fandoms? Does the amount of clicks line up with the amount of likes?

# Bio
I am a rising senior at UC Berkeley in the English and History departments, focusing on new media and fan studies. I am fascinated with fanfiction and the cultures, tropes, and norms within it, and will be writing my honors thesis off of the data found in this project.
